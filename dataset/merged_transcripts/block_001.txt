[0.00 - 17.00]  Part 1.
[17.00 - 18.50]  Doctorose First Law.
[18.50 - 23.98]  Anytime someone puts a lock on something that belongs to you and won't give you the key,

[0.00 - 3.16]  there for your benefit.
[3.16 - 7.48]  On the coining of laws, I gave a speech to a bunch of publishers at the O'Reilly Tools
[7.48 - 11.80]  of Change for Publishing Conference in New York in 2009.
[11.80 - 15.78]  And halfway through, I said, I'm not often certain about something, but I'm certain
[15.78 - 16.78]  of this.
[16.78 - 21.00]  I'm so certain of it that I'm willing to call it Doctor O's Law.
[21.00 - 22.00]  Everyone laughed.
[22.00 - 25.00]  Later, I mentioned this casually to my agent, Russ Galen.

[0.00 - 3.72]  I like to repeat my laugh lines until they're warm rather thin, I'm afraid.
[3.72 - 8.48]  It's a habit I inherited from my grandfather who liked to grind away his jokes to micron
[8.48 - 9.48]  thickness.
[9.48 - 14.28]  Russ sat up very straight and said, No, you must have three laws.
[14.28 - 19.24]  Russ represented Arthur C. Clark in much of his career and continues to represent Clark's
[19.24 - 20.24]  estate.
[20.24 - 24.88]  And of course, Clark got a lot of mileage out of Clark's three laws.

[0.00 - 5.00]  took the advice to heart.
[5.00 - 11.20]  Chapter 1.0 Every grand theory has to start some, ascribe some first cause to all that
[11.20 - 12.20]  comes.
[12.20 - 13.20]  It's a bit of an artificial exercise.
[13.20 - 17.28]  But of course, everything complicated has complicated causes.
[17.28 - 18.28]  But you need to start.
[18.28 - 23.32]  I'm going to start with the World Intellectual Property Rule, founded in 1967 as a successor
[23.32 - 24.96]  to the Bureau of International...

[0.00 - 8.60]  Reune pour la protection de la propiété intellectuelle, the BIRPI, then just shy of its 70th birthday.
[8.60 - 13.00]  WIPO was later subsumed into the United Nations as a specialized agent.
[13.00 - 19.60]  WIPO writes the world's major copyright treaties to recent and important exceptions, ACTA and TPP.
[19.60 - 20.40]  I'll get to that.
[20.40 - 25.00]  And in that regard, it has the same relationship to stupid copyright laws.
