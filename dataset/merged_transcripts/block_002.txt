[0.00 - 2.80]  that Mordor has to evil in Middle Earth.
[2.80 - 6.50]  It is the origin of the prime move in 1996,
[6.50 - 11.00]  WIPO approved the WIPO Copyright Treaty, or the WCT.
[11.00 - 14.80]  And it's cousin, the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty, the PPT.
[14.80 - 20.20]  Collectively, they are called the Internet Treaties, by International Copyright Walks.
[20.20 - 23.60]  And if you want to understand the market for creative works on the internet,
[23.60 - 25.00]  for movies, books,

[0.00 - 5.12]  songs, and anything else that can be sold digitally, you have to understand something
[5.12 - 6.72]  about these treaties.
[6.72 - 13.68]  Specifically, you need to understand one key aspect of the WCT, anti-circumvention.
[13.68 - 16.80]  That's what I'm going to discuss in this chapter.
[16.80 - 18.80]  The WCT is every.
[18.80 - 23.48]  When the UN writes a treaty, it asks the countries of the world to sign onto it.
[23.48 - 25.00]  These signatories go on to pass now.

[0.00 - 5.44]  laws that reflect their obligations under these treaties. In the USA, the WCT was enacted into law
[5.44 - 11.64]  in 1998 as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the DMCA. A few years later, the European Union
[11.64 - 19.00]  created the EU Copyright EECD, in which each EU country then turned into law in its national body.
[19.00 - 23.56]  What that means is that most of the world's industrialized countries have some version of
[23.56 - 25.56]  the WCT.

[0.00 - 4.38]  Implementations of the WCT vary, but usually the variations are small.
[4.38 - 10.22]  For that reason, I'm going to talk about the effect of WCT as a global phenomenon,
[10.22 - 18.70]  not limited to the USA, the EU, Australia, Japan, or anywhere else.
[18.70 - 23.74]  Chapter 1.1 Anti-Circumvention What the hell is anti-circumvention?
[23.74 - 25.74]  Loosely speaking, it's a lot of...

[0.00 - 5.12]  against circumventing around a digital lock. Pretty much everyone in the world has experienced
[5.12 - 9.60]  a digital lock. Ever tried to fast forward to the anti-piracy warning at the start of a DVD
[9.60 - 15.12]  and gotten an action not allowed message? That's a digital lock. In order to legally allow you to
[15.12 - 20.72]  de-scramble the movie on your DVD, your DVD player manufacturer has to sign a license agreement that
[20.72 - 24.96]  says, I promise I will design my player so that users can't skip anti-piracy.
