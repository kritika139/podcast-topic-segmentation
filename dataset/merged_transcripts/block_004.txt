[0.00 - 4.56]  for scrambling. These algorithms are usually public and well understood, because no one
[4.56 - 9.06]  is ever sure if an algorithm is secure until all her peers get a chance to look at it and
[9.06 - 14.24]  check it over her flaws. Third, there's the key, a secret password that's fed into the
[14.24 - 19.72]  algorithm along clear text in order to produce the scrambled file. This scrambled file,
[19.72 - 25.00]  the fourth thing is called the ciphered and in that state it's an indecipherable mess.

[0.00 - 5.52]  of no value to anyone unless they have the key to scramble it. People can copy this encrypted
[5.52 - 11.12]  file all they want and it won't ever substitute for the legit product because it's indistinguishable
[11.12 - 16.64]  from random noise. With the algorithm works, the file can't be unscrambled unless you have that key.
[17.20 - 23.04]  With a digital lock, the player, the Kindle, the DVD player, a software program that plays or

[0.00 - 5.68]  a copy of the secret key embedded in it. You load the ciphertext file on the player,
[5.68 - 10.48]  it unscrambles the file and lets you see the clear text, and then it throws the clear text
[10.48 - 13.92]  away when you're done.
[13.92 - 18.08]  How Compatibility Works If you've been using computers for a long time,
[18.08 - 23.16]  you probably remember where there were multiple incompatible ways of creating documents. You'd
[23.16 - 25.00]  send someone your Apple Work spreadsheet.

[0.00 - 2.94]  sheet, and they'd complain that they only had Excel.
[2.94 - 6.48]  You'd send them a Word document, and they'd only have Word perfect.
[6.48 - 10.16]  Over time, this ceased to be a problem, mostly because these programs started
[10.16 - 14.28]  including an automatic feature for reading and writing each other's files.
[14.28 - 16.32]  At first, this was complicated.
[16.32 - 18.36]  You'd try to open a word processor in your program,
[18.36 - 21.76]  would ask you if you wanted it converted from some obscure file for
[21.76 - 24.00]  the one your program could understand.
[24.00 - 24.96]  Then it became automatic.

[0.00 - 6.00]  you've stopped asking and just automatically you fed it converting as need be. Likewise,
[6.00 - 12.08]  in the early days of web browsers, there were lots of warring graphics, a whole acronym salads work,
[12.08 - 21.60]  GIF, JPEG, PNG, SVG, BMP. Depending on the page you visited and the browser you get little red X's
[21.60 - 26.88]  or error messages telling you your browser wasn't compatible.
