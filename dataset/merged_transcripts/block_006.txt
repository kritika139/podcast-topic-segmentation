[0.00 - 4.22]  they'll sell your movies and give you 70% of the revenue and even better
[4.22 - 9.86]  They'll promise you that they'll keep your movies safe from piracy by putting their digital locks on them at first
[10.16 - 14.84]  Everything's great. You're making money. They're making you sell a million
[14.84 - 22.78]  Five million ten million then they squeeze on the 3070 split was just an introductory now that they proven out great
[22.78 - 24.78]  Their technology is they want it

[0.00 - 7.30]  At the current rate of sale, that means you'll be giving them millions of dollars every month.
[7.30 - 12.30]  Money you were putting back into your own business, using to create more art, using to pay your
[12.30 - 13.46]  own overhead.
[13.46 - 16.02]  Without anti-circumvention, this is easy.
[16.02 - 20.10]  You just call a meeting with the video distributor and say, no deal.
[20.10 - 23.78]  First of all, there are plenty of other operators out there who can do what you do.
[23.78 - 24.78]  You're the distributor.
[24.78 - 25.78]  You're just a distributor.

[0.00 - 5.68]  job is to provide invisible commodity plumbing that puts our movies in front of our audience.
[5.68 - 9.92]  Second of all, for the money you're talking about, we could just skip the middleman and
[9.92 - 16.20]  build our own system. So, yeah, no deal. It's your copyright. You have all the negotiating
[16.20 - 23.08]  footage. But this works only if your audience can follow you from the old 40 new ones. If
[23.08 - 25.08]  I'm your audience and I spent a thousand...

[0.00 - 3.56]  In my movie library, I don't want to have the investment.
[3.56 - 9.68]  I want to be able to use one family of devices and one program to manage my movies.
[9.68 - 15.32]  I'm not going to try to remember which movie goes with which player and which device, and
[15.32 - 22.24]  I'm certainly not going to get a new box under my TV just for your movies, let alone a new
[22.24 - 23.44]  TV.

[0.00 - 5.20]  circumvention to the mix, all of copyright's protection is handed directly to the company
[5.20 - 11.04]  that slapped a digital lock on the product. The filmmaker can't authorize audiences to break
[11.04 - 17.28]  those locks and convert their movies to play on a new device. The investor can't authorize that
[17.28 - 23.36]  either. Only the distributor has the right to allow this. The distributor who stands to lose
[23.36 - 24.88]  everything if it happens.
