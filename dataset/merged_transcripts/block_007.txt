[0.00 - 4.96]  Here's another snippet. Imagine for a moment that every book you bought at Walmart could be
[4.96 - 10.88]  shelved only on a bookcase from Walmart. The books were designed with some kind of little divot
[10.88 - 16.96]  in the spine so that they could sit flat only on a Walmart shelf and printed with a special ink
[16.96 - 22.48]  that glowed only under a Walmart light bulb and only when held at a special angle you could attain
[22.48 - 24.88]  only by sitting in a specially designed Walmart.

[0.00 - 6.36]  Every time you sold a $10 book through Walmart, that would be $10 worth of investment in this
[6.36 - 12.00]  Walmart ecosystem your readers would feel beholden to, even if you and all their other
[12.00 - 16.48]  favorite authors would later offer a better deal at Barnes & Noble.
[16.48 - 20.48]  Meanwhile, you'd only get 50 cents of that $10 royalties if that.
[20.48 - 23.48]  It's easy to understand why Walmart loves this.
[23.48 - 25.00]  It creates a winner takes all money.

[4.60 - 10.60]  The question is, why should authors or publishers want to have anything to do with a scheme
[10.60 - 11.60]  like that?
[11.60 - 13.36]  Digital locks are Roche Motel.
[13.36 - 16.84]  Copyrighted works check in, but they don't check out.
[16.84 - 19.44]  Creators and investors lose control of their business.

[5.72 - 11.28]  world, learned this the hard way in 2000. Amazon demanded a deeper wholesale discount
[11.28 - 16.96]  on Ashet. Amazon retaliated by blacking out many Ashet titles on its site, including books
[16.96 - 22.84]  by best sellers like JK Rowling, either marking them as unavailable or on backorder, and even
[22.84 - 25.04]  suggesting books by other public...

[0.00 - 4.34]  publishers, or used copies of the A'Shatt titles as alternatives.
[4.34 - 10.10]  A'Shatt, the most fervent digital lock advocate in the publishing world, was reduced to offering
[10.10 - 13.06]  scolding comments in retaliation.
[13.06 - 16.82]  If it hadn't been for the locks in the A'Shatt titles, the company would have had a much
