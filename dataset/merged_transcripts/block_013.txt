[0.00 - 5.28]  log inputs on your computer and recapture video. All of these methods are admittedly
[5.28 - 10.00]  tedious. If you really wanted to go into the lock pit, you'd have to know something about
[10.00 - 15.84]  program. The truth is that most digital locks that anyone cares about are broken in a day or two.
[15.84 - 23.76]  In 2006, a programmer who called himself Newslix64 broke the locks on a software-based HD DV. He
[23.76 - 24.96]  chose the player because...

[0.00 - 5.36]  to break. That is, it was the one with the worst security. Remember that people who attack
[5.36 - 11.84]  digital locks get to pick their targets and they generally choose back to Musilix 60. He
[11.84 - 17.60]  reasoned that while he was playing an HDDDD movie. The encryption keys must be somewhere
[17.60 - 23.36]  in his computer's memory. So he put on a movie and looked through the memory until he found the
[23.36 - 24.96]  key he wanted. After

[0.00 - 6.28]  he announced his success, another programmer, Arnazami, used Musilix 64's methods to find
[6.28 - 11.76]  a key that could be applied even more widely. The 09F9 processing key, which can be written
[11.76 - 24.96]  out as 09F9 1102 9D74 E3 5B 851 4156

[0.00 - 5.00]  C5, 63, 56, 88, C0.
[5.00 - 6.50]  That's hexadecimal.
[6.50 - 11.00]  One of the counting systems used by computer probe in decimal, the number looks like this.
[11.00 - 25.00]  13, 256, 278, 887, 989, 457, 651, 018, 865, 901, 401, 704, 642.

[0.00 - 5.68]  Once this secret was released onto the net, any skilled programmer write a program that
[5.68 - 12.40]  descramble HD DVD movies. If she so chose, she could include the option to convert HD DVDs
[12.40 - 17.68]  to unscramble video files that could be played without restrictions. And more piracy warnings,
[17.68 - 24.88]  more ads. And who could play the DVDs you bought anywhere in the world, not just on players that
