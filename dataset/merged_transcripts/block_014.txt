[0.00 - 2.60]  came from the same country as the disk.
[2.60 - 5.36]  Muclic's 64-story is instructive.
[5.36 - 8.12]  He attacked the weakest point in the systems he did.
[8.12 - 10.32]  The whole system failed.
[10.32 - 12.40]  There was a weird Keystone cops move
[12.40 - 15.00]  when the big studios and their technology partners
[15.00 - 19.08]  tried to prevent publication of the 09 F9 key.
[19.08 - 21.64]  Every time they did, it made the news
[21.64 - 23.36]  and affronted internet users,
[23.36 - 25.16]  republished it somewhere else.

[0.00 - 3.84]  Soon, there were millions of copies of the number.
[3.84 - 12.74]  As of July 2014, Google knew of about 518,000 webpages containing the secret number.
[12.74 - 16.60]  Other keys have been discovered since the programmers routinely turn these extracted
[16.60 - 21.56]  keys into programs that automatically strip the locks off of digital files so you need
[21.56 - 25.00]  to be able to take a lock off yourself in order to accomplish this.

[0.00 - 4.96]  When a programmer writes a lock-breaking, she effectively bottles her expertise and sends
[4.96 - 5.96]  it to you.
[5.96 - 10.68]  Still, many of these lock-breaking programs are written with a technical audience in mind
[10.68 - 16.32]  and are pretty tricky to get working, though some, like the DVD-ripping program Handbrake
[16.32 - 20.84]  I mentioned earlier, rate with any commercial software for easy use.
[20.84 - 24.68]  But chances are someone has already taken care of that, too.

[0.00 - 5.04]  key is used to decrypt countless files by knowledgeable audience members eager to liberate
[5.04 - 9.44]  their media before the enforcement catches up. You can just search the internet for a
[9.44 - 16.28]  copy of the movie, book, game, or song you want. It's a safe bet that someone somewhere
[16.28 - 21.72]  is already unlocked it and put it out there for you to download. Or, as they say on the

[8.72 - 11.56]  get the same protection that video games and blockbuster.
[11.56 - 17.24]  But books aren't like books are old, much older than copyright, older than property,
[17.24 - 18.44]  older than markets.
