[0.00 - 4.64]  is in the hands of the owner. A movie would thus be watermarked with its owner's information,
[4.64 - 11.44]  saying effectively, I am Corey Doctorow's copy of Star Wars. If a DVD player that isn't registered
[11.44 - 17.12]  or a doctor or play the movie, it's locked out. Or, alternatively, companies could look on file
[17.12 - 22.40]  sharing sites for illicit copies of their movies, use watermarks to figure out whom these copies
[22.40 - 24.80]  originated with and sue or black.

[0.00 - 2.50]  or otherwise punish that person.
[2.50 - 5.42]  Or maybe they could simply use the watermarked player
[5.42 - 8.88]  was found to be weak enough to allow their locks to be removed.
[8.88 - 12.58]  And future media could be made inaccessible to that model.
[12.58 - 15.82]  All of these solutions are rife with problems.
[15.82 - 17.46]  You can disallow some players,
[17.46 - 19.66]  but you can't stop coders from writing and distributing
[19.66 - 20.82]  their own playback pro.
[20.82 - 23.06]  You'd also have a hard time finding a judge
[23.06 - 25.06]  who'd convict someone of copyright.

[0.00 - 5.00]  because the media originally sold to them was now available elsewhere.
[5.00 - 11.00]  You'd have to prove that they released the files themselves rather than say that they lost their laptop
[11.00 - 17.00]  or sold it or lost it in a divorce or gave it to their children or had it stolen.
[17.00 - 20.00]  Finally, there's the big technical problem.
[20.00 - 25.00]  A watermark can't be truly imperceptible unless you also want it to be used.

[0.00 - 1.00]  This is useless.
[1.00 - 5.04]  Imagine a photo with the words copyright Corey Doctorow written in letters that couldn't
[5.04 - 7.04]  be seen without a powerful microscope.
[7.04 - 10.96]  A copy of the photo without the copyright would appear functionally identical to the
[10.96 - 14.24]  copyright unless you went to great lengths to inspect it.
[14.24 - 18.16]  Of course, you could write copyright Corey Doctorow across the photo in 4-inch black
[18.16 - 22.52]  letters, but you could have a hard time selling a photo like that.
[22.52 - 28.52]  Watermarkers have tried to ground, but that leads to a lot of confusion.

[0.00 - 5.52]  their work exposed. People who want to remove watermarks can just get two or more copies in the
[5.52 - 10.48]  file, compare them, bite by bite, look for the bites that are different in each file,
[10.48 - 17.12]  and scramble those job done. Ed Felton mentioned earlier, once assembled a team of researchers
[17.12 - 22.08]  that looked at the difficulty of removing the secured digital music initiative watermark,
[22.08 - 25.12]  the product of the most ambitious and expensive
