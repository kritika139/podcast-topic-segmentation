[0.00 - 7.00]  expensive watermarking project ever undertaken, figured out how to do it.

[10.40 - 11.40]  Understanding General Purpose
[11.40 - 15.72]  Back at the dawn of mechanical computation, computers were special purpose.
[15.72 - 21.40]  One computer would solve one kind of mathematical problem, but during World War II, thanks to
[21.40 - 25.00]  the government funded advancements made by such scientific luminary

[0.00 - 6.96]  as Alan Turing and John von Neumann, a new kind of new existence, the general purpose digital.
[6.96 - 11.20]  These machines arose from a theory of general purpose computation that showed that with a
[11.20 - 16.56]  simple set of logic gates and enough memory and time, you could compute any program that could
[16.56 - 22.32]  be represented symbolically. That is, general purpose computers are machines capable of running
[22.32 - 24.72]  every valid program you can write.

[0.00 - 3.44]  This principle gave birth to the modern computer as we understand it.
[3.44 - 7.80]  It suggests that all computers are equivalent on a fundamental level.
[7.80 - 12.72]  Any computational task can run on any computer, though some computers might take trillions
[12.72 - 14.64]  of years to run the whole program.
[14.64 - 16.96]  It's nearly miraculous this business.
[16.96 - 20.72]  Until the middle of the last century, most computers were purpose-built to compute in
[20.72 - 22.52]  one particular way.
[22.52 - 25.00]  Today we can and do routine...

[0.00 - 6.60]  we make computers that can compute in every describable way. Our world is made up of general
[6.60 - 11.22]  purpose computers. This is the major reason that digital locks have been dead on arrival
[11.22 - 15.84]  since their first and why they continue to fail. We know how to build a computer that
[15.84 - 20.12]  can solve one kind of problem like the adding machine and we know how to build a computer
[20.12 - 24.76]  that can solve all kinds of things. But we don't know how to design and build a computer

[0.00 - 6.48]  that can run every program except one program that pisses off endangers or harms the entertainment
[6.48 - 12.16]  in them. The computer that runs everything minus one has no basis in theory. Maybe some
[12.16 - 16.32]  21st century Alan Turing will invent it, but no one has yet stepped forward with such a
[16.32 - 21.32]  design. And the consensus of computer science is that such a design is not feasible, which
[21.32 - 25.00]  means that we can't deliver on the promise of digital law.
