[0.00 - 4.28]  Of course, that hasn't stopped the entertainment industry from trying to approximate the effect
[4.28 - 7.28]  of a computer that doesn't run a certain program.
[7.28 - 8.64]  And that's where the trouble is.
[8.64 - 12.44]  Instead of building computers that are incapable of running a program that makes copies of
[12.44 - 18.84]  files that shouldn't be copied, we make computers that are designed to run all programs.
[18.84 - 23.92]  Then we add software that watches what that computer's user does at all times and that
[23.92 - 25.00]  secretly kills.

[0.00 - 5.44]  any process, a program that does something the entertainment industry doesn't like.
[5.44 - 10.64]  As a rule, computer owners don't want their computers to disobey their orders.
[10.64 - 15.04]  From the owner's perspective, a computer that won't make copies when you want it to
[15.04 - 20.48]  is broken, so digital locks need to be designed for stealth as well as vigilance.
[20.48 - 24.88]  They need to disguise themselves from users and hide their workings from the operating

[0.00 - 6.08]  There's only one class of programs that behaves this way, hiding itself from users and doing
[6.08 - 8.56]  things that users don't want.
[8.56 - 9.56]  Spyware.
[9.56 - 15.44]  Chapter 1.6 Root Kits Every.
[15.44 - 20.32]  The major strategy behind spyware and anti-copying software is called a root kit.
[20.32 - 24.44]  Root kits are programs that covertly modify a computer's operating to blind it to certain
[24.44 - 25.44]  files.

[0.00 - 5.36]  process. Once a computer has been compromised by a root kit, it will not see the files associated
[5.36 - 10.32]  with the malicious software it can seal. If you open a folder containing a malicious program on
[10.32 - 15.36]  a root kit infected computer, the program won't be visible in the folder's listing. Nor will you
[15.36 - 20.40]  be able to see any of the processes associated with that program. If you go to your computer's
[20.40 - 24.88]  process mod utility that lists all the programs on your computer, the malicious program

[0.00 - 3.76]  will not appear on the list, even if it's running.
[3.76 - 5.36]  It's useful to think of this in terms
[5.36 - 7.00]  of your own immune system.
[7.00 - 9.60]  A healthy immune system is capable of recognizing
[9.60 - 11.92]  and categorizing the stuff in your body.
[11.92 - 14.20]  When your immune system is working well,
[14.20 - 16.96]  it can distinguish between help of gut bacteria,
[16.96 - 20.88]  toxic infectious bacteria inhabiting a cut on your hand,
[20.88 - 22.68]  and your own cells.
[22.68 - 25.08]  Autoimmune disorders occur when your immune system
