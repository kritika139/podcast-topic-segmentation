[0.00 - 4.56]  gets confused. Sometimes your immune system will erroneously identify your own body as
[4.56 - 10.58]  a harmful foreign agent and attack it, causing anything from mild allergies to horrific and
[10.58 - 15.74]  fading outbreaks. On the other hand, sometimes your immune system stops being able to combat
[15.74 - 20.62]  harmful organisms and lets them multiply without interference. This is what happens when pneumonia
[20.62 - 25.02]  brings immune systems and being compromised by HIV. It's not a coincidence that's

[0.00 - 6.68]  spyware and digital locks use the same root kit techniques. In 2005, Sony BMG
[6.68 - 12.24]  shipped 6 million audio CDs loaded with a secret root kit that covertly
[12.24 - 17.32]  installed itself when you inserted one of these CDs into your computer. Once your
[17.32 - 23.20]  computer had been compromised, any file that began with string sys string was
[23.20 - 26.88]  invisible to the op...

[0.00 - 7.28]  So, a file called string-sys-string-rootkit.exe wouldn't show up when you looked in the folder
[7.28 - 8.84]  containing it.
[8.84 - 15.00]  And when that program ran, string-sys-string-rootkit.exe wouldn't be listed in the process.
[15.00 - 19.82]  The Sony rootkit was used to cloak a program that watched for and then killed attempts
[19.82 - 22.84]  to copy music off of audio CDs from the users.
[22.84 - 25.00]  It looked like your computer had suddenly developed a system.

[0.00 - 3.84]  serious bug that stopped CD ripping software from running.
[3.84 - 6.68]  This is the equivalent of an autoimmune allergy.
[6.68 - 11.92]  The computer's owner has a process that she wants to run a CD copying process, but the
[11.92 - 17.24]  computer erroneously identifies that program as undesirable and kills it every time it
[17.24 - 20.84]  tries to start, but it didn't stop there.
[20.84 - 24.96]  Once there were millions of computers in the wild that couldn't see files that started

[0.00 - 7.00]  string-siss-string, virus writers started to add string-siss-string to the names of their programs too.
[7.00 - 12.00]  This was the digital equivalent of H. Your computer could no longer detect bad programs
[12.00 - 17.00]  because it had had a gaping hole punched through the middle of its immune system.
[17.00 - 22.00]  Any program that adopted the protective coloration of Sony's anti-copying tool
[22.00 - 25.00]  could cloak itself in Sony's root kit.
