[0.00 - 4.74]  Thus, we arrive at yet another problem with digital locks.
[4.74 - 7.14]  Fundamental, the only way to get computers
[7.14 - 10.34]  to resist users' attempts to see what's going on inside them
[10.34 - 12.66]  is to design programs with the facility
[12.66 - 15.22]  to misreport their files and process.
[15.22 - 17.70]  Forcing such programs on users
[17.70 - 20.78]  inevitably opens the door to spyware.
[20.78 - 24.02]  What Your PC Seed?
[24.02 - 25.10]  In 2009,

[0.00 - 5.76]  a scandal erupted in Lower Marion, Pennsylvania, an affluent suburb of Philadelphia.
[5.76 - 10.64]  The Lower Marion School District had used state grants to supply 2,300 high school
[10.64 - 15.52]  students with district-owned laptops. These computers came loaded with secret software
[15.52 - 20.96]  that could operate the laptop's cameras covertly. When the software ran, the camera's green activity
[20.96 - 24.96]  lights stayed dark, as well as capture screen graphs and copy the files on the

[4.40 - 6.76]  to track down stolen laptops.
[6.76 - 8.96]  But that's not how it was used.
[8.96 - 13.76]  Instead, a student discovered the software's existence when he was called into his assistant
[13.76 - 17.28]  principal's office and accused of taking narcotics.
[17.28 - 23.44]  He denied the charge and was presented with a photo taken the night before in his bedroom
[23.44 - 25.04]  showing him consuming.

[1.96 - 4.56]  The student explained that these were Mike and Ike candies
[4.56 - 6.84]  and then proceeded to ask how the hell
[6.84 - 9.70]  the assistant principal had taken a picture of him
[9.70 - 12.10]  in his bedroom at night.
[12.10 - 13.80]  It emerged that this student,
[13.80 - 18.08]  a number of others, had been photographed thousands of times
[18.08 - 21.40]  by their laptops' cameras without their knowledge.

[4.38 - 9.46]  Chapter 1.7 Appliances A recent trend in the computer industry is to sell general-purpose
[9.46 - 13.50]  computers as appliances with limited functionality.
[13.50 - 17.82]  In the last few years, companies have embedded computers into digital photo frames, home
[17.82 - 23.14]  Wi-Fi routers, portable music players, pacemakers, and car dashboards.
[23.14 - 24.14]  This is inevitable.
