[0.00 - 5.52]  Purpose computers are made in enormous quantities and boast ever-increasing speed and ever-decreasing
[5.52 - 6.52]  price.
[6.52 - 9.28]  Why make a special purpose chip that can only tell the time?
[9.28 - 13.52]  And three, when there's an off-the-shelf alternative that can do all that and more,
[13.52 - 16.08]  available at a fraction of the cost.
[16.08 - 20.88]  I love my digital phone, my bedside clock, the router that runs my own broadband, the
[20.88 - 23.36]  waterproof music layer I use when I swim.
[23.36 - 24.96]  The availability of general purpose...

[0.00 - 5.44]  technology has tempted some companies into digital lock territory and that's where it starts to go
[5.44 - 10.96]  sour. Take home broadband, many companies would like to offer different models the same router
[10.96 - 16.56]  with varying features. The basic model that does just Wi-Fi, a more deluxe version that can also
[16.56 - 21.12]  serve as a voice over icon telephone and a top of the range version that can do the kind of
[21.12 - 24.88]  sophisticated routing tricks used by major corporations and universities.

[0.00 - 2.80]  to manage enormous complex network.
[2.80 - 6.44]  The thing is, it's often cheaper to base all three models
[6.44 - 8.48]  on exactly the same hardware
[8.48 - 11.12]  and simply load different software and the factor
[11.12 - 12.72]  to make the products different.
[12.72 - 15.04]  This is innocuous in and of itself.
[15.04 - 17.28]  However, it leads to something awfully.
[17.28 - 19.08]  Once a company stands to lose money
[19.08 - 21.96]  by allowing customers to examine and modify its products
[21.96 - 24.68]  after they're sold by switching out that software,
[24.68 - 26.68]  it creates a new product.

[0.00 - 4.56]  It's a perverse incentive to treat customers as threats and to try to hide the workings
[4.56 - 6.52]  of their devices from them.
[6.52 - 11.28]  This means that digital appliances are very different from their analog cousins.
[11.28 - 14.52]  An electric motor is useful in both a hand drill and a blender.
[14.52 - 18.56]  Once you install the motor in the blender, it becomes difficult to use it in a hand drill,
[18.56 - 20.94]  but there's nothing stopping you from trying.
[20.94 - 23.88]  You can use your blender in ways the manufacturer never thought of.
[23.88 - 28.40]  You can mix pink with a hand drill.

[0.00 - 2.72]  or take it to your high school lab for experiments.
[2.72 - 6.48]  And while it's true that it would take an extraordinary measure to turn your blender
[6.48 - 11.28]  into a hand drill, that's not because the manufacturer has spent good money to stop
[11.28 - 14.80]  you from doing it. Figured it out, it wouldn't be against the law to do it,
[14.80 - 20.24]  or to tell others how you did it, or even to sell blender drill conversion kits.
[20.24 - 25.04]  Contrast that with digital. A digital appliance isn't a computer that's had
