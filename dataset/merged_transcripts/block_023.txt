[0.00 - 5.20]  all its features removed so that it can run only the appliance program instead. It's usually a
[5.20 - 10.88]  fully functional general-purpose computer capable of running every program that's shipped with spyware
[10.88 - 15.28]  and other countermeasures installed so that it comes out of the box treating you its owner
[15.28 - 20.32]  as an attacker and does everything it can think of to stop you from seeing it's interworking.
[20.32 - 24.88]  It's more if you do figure out how to get inside the machine and make it do more than the manufacturer

[0.00 - 5.28]  intended, for example, if you jailbreak an iPad, you're very likely breaking the law,
[5.28 - 9.24]  and you're prohibited from telling anyone how you did it or from going into business
[9.24 - 13.64]  doing it yourself.
[13.64 - 17.80]  Chapter 1.8 Proto Appliances, the inkjet wars
[17.80 - 23.24]  An early example of the adversarial appliance model is the inkjet print official licensed
[23.24 - 25.00]  inkjet ink is just about the money.

[0.00 - 5.04]  most expensive liquid you can buy, costing more per ounce than vintage champagne.
[5.04 - 8.34]  That's because the business model of niche printer companies has been to sell printers
[8.34 - 12.90]  cheaply, sometimes even at a loss, and then to make their profits on the ink re.
[12.90 - 17.46]  This works only if users can't refill their cartridges themselves or use a competitor's
[17.46 - 18.46]  ink.
[18.46 - 22.94]  If HP is marking up its colored water at 100,000% margins, you'd expect a competitor
[22.94 - 25.02]  to come along and offer the same product at a more…

[0.00 - 6.64]  modest 1,000% margin. But HP protects its margins by designing print inner workings
[6.64 - 12.24]  archived secrets from the owners of the 100 million odd HP today. No one is supposed to
[12.24 - 16.48]  know how HP's operating systems work because that would help them figure out how to trick
[16.48 - 22.16]  HP printers into accepting refill, remanufactured, and third-party ink customers. Every time that
[22.16 - 25.12]  happens, HP loses out on a hugely profitable

[0.00 - 1.36]  of the Valkar church sale.
[1.36 - 6.28]  The secrecy isn't just harmful to HP printer owners' wallets,
[6.28 - 8.72]  it's harmful to their security.
[8.72 - 12.00]  In 2011, Columbia computer science grad student,
[12.00 - 16.12]  Ang Choy, conducted research into the security of HP printers.
[16.12 - 18.76]  HP refused to disclose the inner workings of its readers
[18.76 - 21.48]  to him, citing commercial confidentiality.
[21.48 - 25.48]  So Choy undertook to reverse engineer their technology.
