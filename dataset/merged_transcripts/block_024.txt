[0.00 - 3.50]  himself and was able to quickly unravel the system.
[3.50 - 7.50]  We found that HP had voted a lot of resources to preventing legal cartridges,
[7.50 - 11.00]  but almost none to other types of security.
[11.00 - 17.00]  To demonstrate this, Toei wrote a simple 200 line program that could turn any document
[17.00 - 20.00]  into a vector for hijacking HP printers.
[20.00 - 25.00]  If Toei could convince you to print his document, for example, he sent a resume.

[0.00 - 4.56]  HR department and they printed it, he could seize control of your printer. Once the printer was
[4.56 - 9.28]  under his control, it would no longer accept software updates from its owner, though it would
[9.28 - 15.20]  pretend to accept them and register them as being successfully installed. It could also spy on
[15.20 - 21.60]  every document printed and send copies to Tway's personal dropbox. It could even look for certain
[21.60 - 24.72]  words or numbers in documents, say social security numbers,

[0.00 - 2.56]  and alter them when the documents were printed.
[2.56 - 7.32]  Toys program also scanned the local network for PCs that had known vulnerabilities that
[7.32 - 9.40]  hadn't been patched with a software update.
[9.40 - 13.88]  Once it found these computers, it took them over, installed Rootkin, and used them to
[13.88 - 18.84]  penetrate their network's firewall and open a connection to Toys' laptop.
[18.84 - 22.76]  In other words, it broke the whole network wide open.
[22.76 - 25.00]  Toys is a very clever security reason.

[0.00 - 2.80]  But he's not a transcendent genius.
[2.80 - 7.30]  It's an uncertainty that other people figured out these techniques independent of them.
[7.30 - 11.84]  And the fact that we never heard about it likely means that they kept them to themselves.
[11.84 - 18.28]  Who sold them the highest bidder in the international identity theft and espionage markets.
[18.28 - 23.28]  Without a thorough understanding of our computers' workings and without independent verification
[23.28 - 25.28]  of their security, it's impossible to...

[0.00 - 6.24]  trust our machines. Adversarial appliances require that computers' workings be kept secret,
[6.24 - 12.08]  and digital lock rules impose civil and criminal penalties on people who discover and publicize
[12.08 - 21.44]  their vulnerabilities. That's a big problem. Carrier IQ, Android, and IOL. In 2011, a security
[21.44 - 24.88]  researcher named Trevor Eckhart discovered that some Android...
