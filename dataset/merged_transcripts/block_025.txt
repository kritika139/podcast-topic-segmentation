[0.00 - 6.00]  phones had shipped with a commercial root kit called Carrier IQ. Carrier IQ bills itself
[6.00 - 10.56]  as a tool for monitoring and improving mobile network performance by gathering statistics
[10.56 - 16.36]  about dropped calls, signal streams, and so on. But as Eckhart demonstrated, Carrier IQ
[16.36 - 21.00]  could do much more on your password than on your phone's keyboard, with your text message
[21.00 - 25.08]  and pinpoint and transmit for location. When Eckhart published his findings,

[0.00 - 5.44]  the carriers performed the classic deny-threatened-down-play tactics, first denying that they'd done
[5.44 - 11.60]  anything wrong, then threatening to sue, then finally sheepishly admitting they're wrong and
[11.60 - 17.28]  apologizing. As this little soap opera was unfolding, the iPhone hacker known as CH Pone used what had
[17.28 - 23.12]  been discovered about carrier IQ to go hunting for it on iPhones, which run iOS, the closed up
[23.12 - 25.12]  rival to the mostly open.

[0.00 - 5.84]  and Android operating. CHPone was able to ascertain that carrier IQ was present on iOS too. Ultimately,
[5.84 - 15.44]  it emerged that over 141 million handsets in the United States had been infected with the carrier
[15.44 - 22.40]  IQ root kit by the carriers themselves without the knowledge or consent of the phones owner.
[22.40 - 24.88]  The important lesson here, apart from the fact, tell

[0.00 - 5.44]  coasts are lying even scum, is that it's easier to spot shenanigans in open systems and closed
[5.44 - 9.52]  systems. It's not a coincidence that the Android Revolution date that's just starting up an item
[9.52 - 15.28]  OSOther, a carrier and manufacturer, is illegal. And security researchers who publish material
[15.28 - 20.56]  about the iPhone's workings face legal jeopardy, as do their publishers, employers, and academic
[20.56 - 24.88]  institutions. The digital lock rules on the BMCA make it illegal to...

[0.00 - 5.12]  figure out how to install your own OS on an iPhone and prohibit publishing any information
[5.12 - 10.20]  that would help someone else do the same. Developers, who are allowed some limited transparency
[10.20 - 15.36]  in inner workings of iOS devices, are required to sign non-disclosure agreements as a condition
[15.36 - 21.12]  of access. Imagine a home security whose burglar detection system lets them secretly listen
[21.12 - 25.00]  in on your private moments at home and watch you through your CCD.
