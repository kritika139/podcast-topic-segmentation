[8.32 - 15.28]  Seven years later, Muslic64 broke HDDVD's DRM for similar reasons. He wanted to watch a legitimate
[15.28 - 21.20]  out-of-region DVD that he'd purchased. Both of these seminal figures in the history of digital
[21.20 - 24.96]  locks were inspired not by piracy, but by frustration.

[0.00 - 4.00]  the limits put on the legitimate media they'd paid good money for.
[4.00 - 10.70]  In 2007, NBC and Apple had a contract with the speed over the terms of sale for Apple's iTunes store.
[10.70 - 14.50]  NBC's material was withdrawn from iTunes for about nine months.
[14.50 - 20.80]  In 2008, researchers from Carnegie Mellon University released a paper investigating the file sharing of this blackout,
[20.80 - 23.80]  converting pirates without cannibalizing purchasers.
[23.80 - 25.00]  The impact of...

[0.00 - 4.98]  digital distribution on physical sales and internet piracy they found was that the contract
[4.98 - 11.34]  dispute resulted in a spike of downloads on pirate sites and not just of NBC material.
[11.34 - 15.56]  It seemed that once people who had been in the habit of buying their shows on iTunes
[15.56 - 21.08]  found their way onto the free-for-all file sharing sites, they clicked on everything

[20.32 - 22.44]  those viewers to piracy.
[22.44 - 24.92]  Once the audience started pirating the content they wanted...

[0.00 - 5.12]  they quickly turned to pirating other content too. Having become aware of and proficient
[5.12 - 11.52]  in downloading, the audience developed a downloading habit that outlasted the end of the blackout.
[11.52 - 15.92]  Digital lock vendors will tell you that their wares aren't perfect, but they're better than nothing.
[16.48 - 21.92]  But the evidence is that digital locks are much worse. Industries that make widespread use of
