[0.00 - 5.22]  to intermediaries. They don't reduce piracy and customers who run into
[5.22 - 9.14]  frustrations with digital locks are given an incentive to learn how to rip
[9.14 - 14.82]  off the whole supply chain. If you're a publisher, label, or studio, the answer is
[14.82 - 20.14]  simple. Don't let companies sell your goods with digital locks on them. And if
[20.14 - 23.82]  a company refuses to sell your goods unless they can put their locks on your
[23.82 - 26.14]  products?

[0.00 - 4.00]  Well, you can be pretty sure that those locks aren't there for your...
[4.00 - 11.00]  It's harder if you're a creator, because many of the biggest investors have bought into the idea of selling DRM or not at all.
[11.00 - 21.00]  When it comes down to negotiating DRM, you just have to make a decision about whether you're willing to let your creative work be put in some tech company's jail in order to make your investors happy,
[21.00 - 25.00]  or whether you'll keep shopping for a sane or better investor.

[0.00 - 4.88]  A few years back, I sold a children's picture book to the largest publisher in the world,
[4.88 - 10.00]  which then spent a couple of years developing it with me, commissioning rough illustrations
[10.00 - 14.40]  and going through several rounds of rewrites until it was something you were all excited about.
[14.40 - 18.72]  One of my editors I am publishing was also the head of its UK digital strategy,
[18.72 - 24.24]  and he and I were very simpatico as you might expect. After several months had gone by without a
[24.24 - 27.44]  contract, she was able to get a copy of the book.

[0.00 - 4.06]  showing up his office, he called me up and explained what had happened. He'd gone
[4.06 - 8.78]  to the contracts people and requested a no DRM guarantee for the digital editions of
[8.78 - 12.78]  my books. None of us thought it would be a problem since Nameless Giant is no other
[12.78 - 17.42]  formats, languages, and territory and in every case, its sales might work. But Nameless
[17.42 - 22.42]  Giant had a new directive from the very top of the business. From now on, all books had
[22.42 - 24.94]  to be acquired with e-book rights and all the books had to be acquired with e-book rights.

[0.00 - 6.72]  all ebooks would have DRM on them. My editor tried to negotiate. Can we not acquire the ebook rights?
[6.72 - 11.60]  No. Okay, how about we acquire them but promise not to use them? But it wasn't.
[11.60 - 16.88]  Finally, my editor explained to the contracts person that the expected return from the digital
[16.88 - 26.56]  edition was negative 80 pounds. That's negative 80 pounds.
