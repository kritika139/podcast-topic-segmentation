[9.44 - 13.96]  The contracts person told my editor that the DRM was non-negotiable and that if it was
[13.96 - 17.28]  going to be a problem, he should cancel my contract.
[17.28 - 21.80]  So my editor was very hard to get angry with an editor who has just quit in protest over
[21.80 - 25.04]  your book getting canceled even in the face of your book.

[6.00 - 11.04]  that I can now easily sell to one of its less doctrine blind competitors and I don't have to
[11.04 - 17.04]  let DRM companies lock up my copyrights. Also, my editor got a much better job.
