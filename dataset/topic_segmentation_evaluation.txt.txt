Topic Segmentation Evaluation

Baseline Approach (TF-IDF Similarity):
- Segments frequently due to word-level variation
- Creates multiple short segments
- Topic boundaries feel abrupt

Embedding-Based Approach:
- Uses semantic similarity between text blocks
- Produces fewer, meaningful segments
- Topic boundaries are more natural and coherent

Final Decision:
Embedding-based segmentation was selected as the final approach
because it better preserves topic continuity and aligns with
human understanding of conversational flow.
