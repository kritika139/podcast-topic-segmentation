[0.00 - 17.00]  Part 1.
[17.00 - 18.50]  Doctorose First Law.
[18.50 - 23.98]  Anytime someone puts a lock on something that belongs to you and won't give you the key,

[0.00 - 3.16]  there for your benefit.
[3.16 - 7.48]  On the coining of laws, I gave a speech to a bunch of publishers at the O'Reilly Tools
[7.48 - 11.80]  of Change for Publishing Conference in New York in 2009.
[11.80 - 15.78]  And halfway through, I said, I'm not often certain about something, but I'm certain
[15.78 - 16.78]  of this.
[16.78 - 21.00]  I'm so certain of it that I'm willing to call it Doctor O's Law.
[21.00 - 22.00]  Everyone laughed.
[22.00 - 25.00]  Later, I mentioned this casually to my agent, Russ Galen.

[0.00 - 3.72]  I like to repeat my laugh lines until they're warm rather thin, I'm afraid.
[3.72 - 8.48]  It's a habit I inherited from my grandfather who liked to grind away his jokes to micron
[8.48 - 9.48]  thickness.
[9.48 - 14.28]  Russ sat up very straight and said, No, you must have three laws.
[14.28 - 19.24]  Russ represented Arthur C. Clark in much of his career and continues to represent Clark's
[19.24 - 20.24]  estate.
[20.24 - 24.88]  And of course, Clark got a lot of mileage out of Clark's three laws.

[0.00 - 5.00]  took the advice to heart.
[5.00 - 11.20]  Chapter 1.0 Every grand theory has to start some, ascribe some first cause to all that
[11.20 - 12.20]  comes.
[12.20 - 13.20]  It's a bit of an artificial exercise.
[13.20 - 17.28]  But of course, everything complicated has complicated causes.
[17.28 - 18.28]  But you need to start.
[18.28 - 23.32]  I'm going to start with the World Intellectual Property Rule, founded in 1967 as a successor
[23.32 - 24.96]  to the Bureau of International...

[0.00 - 8.60]  Reune pour la protection de la propiété intellectuelle, the BIRPI, then just shy of its 70th birthday.
[8.60 - 13.00]  WIPO was later subsumed into the United Nations as a specialized agent.
[13.00 - 19.60]  WIPO writes the world's major copyright treaties to recent and important exceptions, ACTA and TPP.
[19.60 - 20.40]  I'll get to that.
[20.40 - 25.00]  And in that regard, it has the same relationship to stupid copyright laws.



===== block_002.txt =====
[0.00 - 2.80]  that Mordor has to evil in Middle Earth.
[2.80 - 6.50]  It is the origin of the prime move in 1996,
[6.50 - 11.00]  WIPO approved the WIPO Copyright Treaty, or the WCT.
[11.00 - 14.80]  And it's cousin, the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty, the PPT.
[14.80 - 20.20]  Collectively, they are called the Internet Treaties, by International Copyright Walks.
[20.20 - 23.60]  And if you want to understand the market for creative works on the internet,
[23.60 - 25.00]  for movies, books,

[0.00 - 5.12]  songs, and anything else that can be sold digitally, you have to understand something
[5.12 - 6.72]  about these treaties.
[6.72 - 13.68]  Specifically, you need to understand one key aspect of the WCT, anti-circumvention.
[13.68 - 16.80]  That's what I'm going to discuss in this chapter.
[16.80 - 18.80]  The WCT is every.
[18.80 - 23.48]  When the UN writes a treaty, it asks the countries of the world to sign onto it.
[23.48 - 25.00]  These signatories go on to pass now.

[0.00 - 5.44]  laws that reflect their obligations under these treaties. In the USA, the WCT was enacted into law
[5.44 - 11.64]  in 1998 as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the DMCA. A few years later, the European Union
[11.64 - 19.00]  created the EU Copyright EECD, in which each EU country then turned into law in its national body.
[19.00 - 23.56]  What that means is that most of the world's industrialized countries have some version of
[23.56 - 25.56]  the WCT.

[0.00 - 4.38]  Implementations of the WCT vary, but usually the variations are small.
[4.38 - 10.22]  For that reason, I'm going to talk about the effect of WCT as a global phenomenon,
[10.22 - 18.70]  not limited to the USA, the EU, Australia, Japan, or anywhere else.
[18.70 - 23.74]  Chapter 1.1 Anti-Circumvention What the hell is anti-circumvention?
[23.74 - 25.74]  Loosely speaking, it's a lot of...

[0.00 - 5.12]  against circumventing around a digital lock. Pretty much everyone in the world has experienced
[5.12 - 9.60]  a digital lock. Ever tried to fast forward to the anti-piracy warning at the start of a DVD
[9.60 - 15.12]  and gotten an action not allowed message? That's a digital lock. In order to legally allow you to
[15.12 - 20.72]  de-scramble the movie on your DVD, your DVD player manufacturer has to sign a license agreement that
[20.72 - 24.96]  says, I promise I will design my player so that users can't skip anti-piracy.



===== block_003.txt =====
[0.00 - 3.68]  piracy one. It's not hard to make a DVD ignore this requirement.
[3.68 - 8.24]  DVD encryption was first built 10 years ago and there are now tons of software
[8.24 - 13.04]  DVD players like Handbrake that can play back any part of the game at any speed,
[13.04 - 18.72]  no matter what region it's from. DVDs contain a region that discs from being bought in one
[18.72 - 24.24]  part of the game played in another. These players also let you save DVDs to your hard drive. Copy
[24.24 - 24.88]  them to your tablet.

[0.00 - 4.24]  it or phone and back them up to your home media source. Curiously, there's no copyright
[4.24 - 10.40]  law that says it's illegal to skip piracy. There is a law, the DMCA in the US, that says
[10.40 - 15.20]  it's illegal to descramble a movie without permission. And this is what makes anti-circumvention
[15.20 - 21.80]  so pernicious. Fundamentally, anti-circumvention is a way of making up new copyright notation,
[21.80 - 25.00]  eliminate the rewind button, limit pausing to 10 minutes.

[0.00 - 2.56]  and force viewers to sit through ads.
[2.56 - 4.44]  Just by scrambling your art
[4.44 - 6.68]  and then saying to the player manufacturers,
[6.68 - 8.08]  you can't just scramble this
[8.08 - 9.76]  unless you honor my requirements.
[9.76 - 12.30]  This may sound like a pretty good deal for career investors.
[12.30 - 14.08]  After all, let's you charge money for stuff
[14.08 - 16.10]  that the audience used to get for free.
[16.10 - 18.30]  When you sold someone a book back in the day,
[18.30 - 20.70]  they got the whole thing in one package, the locks.
[20.70 - 23.64]  You can sell them only the right to look at the book
[23.64 - 24.96]  after 6 p.m.

[0.00 - 5.44]  physically located in North America and not in a commercial establishment. If they want the
[5.44 - 10.48]  read on the subway rights, those can be sold. I'll come back to what this means for audience
[10.48 - 15.12]  members later in this book. But for now, let's stick with the impact this has on creators and
[15.12 - 21.28]  investors. Is it really a good deal for them? Or has anti-circumvention ended up taking negotiating
[21.28 - 24.96]  power away from people who make and finance art and he

[0.00 - 5.00]  handing it to companies that make digital locks.
[5.00 - 6.24]  Crypto 101.
[6.24 - 10.44]  You don't have to be a cryptographer to understand this stuff, but you do need to have a conceptual
[10.44 - 13.40]  grasp of the way that scrambling and de-scrambling.
[13.40 - 15.60]  Fundamentally, this is about four things.
[15.60 - 20.08]  First, there's the unscrambled file, called the Clear Text, which would be the movie you
[20.08 - 22.60]  watch, the song you hear, or the book.
[22.60 - 25.00]  There's an algorithm, a mathematical system.
