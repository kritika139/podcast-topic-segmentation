[0.00 - 5.92]  someone's animated dancing hamster image. But today, your browser just reads and displays
[5.92 - 12.32]  all those files without batting an iRidge. What happened? Well, programmers made them compatible
[12.32 - 17.76]  with the other format. This is something that is very hard to do in the physical world. Making
[17.76 - 23.76]  your toaster compatible with a dishwasher isn't a project for the faint of heart. But it's routine
[23.76 - 24.80]  in the digital world.

[0.00 - 2.62]  not where digital locks are concerned.
[2.62 - 4.82]  Here's where the problem for creators and investors,
[4.82 - 7.02]  because anti-circumvention rules mean
[7.02 - 9.90]  that only a digital locks maker can authorize you

[13.90 - 15.66]  often aren't allowed.
[15.66 - 19.18]  That's how copyright ceases to protect creative works
[19.18 - 22.38]  and begins to protect digital locks instead.

[6.92 - 12.96]  as copy protection. That is, protection against having problems, sometimes as copyright protect.
[12.96 - 17.48]  We can debate their claim to the former, but we should certainly reject the idea that digital
[17.48 - 22.36]  locks protect copyright. As things stand now, it's the other way around. Many different
[22.36 - 25.00]  reasons and rationales for copyright have been offered.

[6.56 - 12.32]  publishers from Scottish competition. Sixty-some years later, the U.S. Constitution provided for
[12.32 - 18.32]  copyright to promote the progress of science and useful arts. The Berne Convention for the Protection
[18.32 - 23.68]  of Artistic and Literary Works, one of the first international copyright agreements, its text was

[5.84 - 11.20]  authorship of a work for and to prevent its distortion or modification. One rationale that
