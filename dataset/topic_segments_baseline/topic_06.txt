[5.92 - 10.72]  Amazon customers could easily convert their purchases to run on competitors' platforms.
[10.72 - 16.88]  But under the DMCA, only Amazon can authorize the conversion of Kindle books to read on

[0.00 - 4.68]  bit of a software lead. He created the first search engine, the Wide Area Information
[4.68 - 11.44]  Server, Waze. Sold it, founded another search company, Alexa, sold it, and then decided to
[11.44 - 17.02]  spend the rest of it at Archive, Archive.org. An amazing public library. Brewster tells
[17.02 - 21.12]  a famous story about life in the shadow of Microsoft during the heyday of the packaged
[21.12 - 25.00]  software industry when all software was sold in boxes hanging from the wall.

[0.00 - 5.92]  pegs and software stores. Back in those days, Microsoft owned 95% of the operating system
[5.92 - 11.76]  market and spent a lot of time extolling the virtues of its platform, Windows, to its partners,
[11.76 - 17.20]  software creators, who wrote Windows program. The Software Vendors Association also spent a lot
[17.20 - 21.52]  of time warning programmers about the risks of piracy and the problems they'd have with their
[21.52 - 24.96]  customers deciding to copy them into the courthouse. This served to

[0.00 - 4.00]  still more creative, which was meant to provide a shield against this threat.
[4.00 - 9.00]  But then Microsoft started to undercut the same companies that had trusted its platform.
[9.00 - 16.00]  In my hometown of Toronto, Del Rina built itself into a huge successful company by selling a ubiquitous fax program, WinFax,
[16.00 - 21.00]  right up to the day that Windows 95 shipped for the free competitor, Straight from Microsoft.
[21.00 - 25.00]  Del Rina, seeing which way the wind was blowing, sold itself,

[0.00 - 5.22]  of Symantec. As Brewster tells it, Microsoft spent years waving one hand over its head,
[5.22 - 11.72]  shouting, Look out pirates, pirates! On the other hand, it held the knife.
[11.72 - 17.96]  Amazon MP3s. A lateral man. What happened to digital locks for music? How did that get
[17.96 - 23.66]  to be the only entertainment category to completely abandon them? Funny story. In the beginning,
[23.66 - 25.00]  there were a bunch of prepri-

[0.00 - 6.12]  Music stores that signed up one or two labels each and distributed music using their own digital locks
[6.64 - 8.64]  No one liked these stores very much
[9.00 - 16.82]  Then Apple created the first iPod in 2001 and went around to the labels and said look these things only work with max
[16.98 - 24.80]  Because they require an obscure cable port called firewire. That's only five percent of the market. Why don't you try and experiment?

[0.00 - 3.44]  and the iTunes store with music from all the big labels.
[3.44 - 7.12]  The experiment turned out to be successful, so successful,
[7.12 - 12.24]  that the labels didn't dare pull out when the iPod started to work with Windows as well.
[12.24 - 15.04]  But Apple had lots of rules about selling music.
[15.04 - 17.68]  You couldn't buy the kind of promotion that the labels wanted,
[17.68 - 21.92]  and you could sell songs for only one price, 99 cents.
[21.92 - 24.88]  The labels hated this. Apple wouldn't bud-

[0.00 - 4.00]  The labels came to realize that they've been caught in yet another Roche motel.
[4.00 - 8.00]  Their customers had bought millions of dollars worth of Apple-locked music,
[8.00 - 13.00]  and if the labels left the iTunes store, the listeners would be hard-pressed to follow them.
[13.00 - 18.00]  Just to make this very clear, Apple threatened a competitor, Real Networks,
[18.00 - 25.00]  when Real released a version of its player that allowed users to load digitally-locked songs bought from the Real...

[0.00 - 5.88]  player store onto an iPod, enabling customers to play both Reels and Apple's music on
[5.88 - 10.68]  the same device. We are stunned that Reel Networks has adopted the tactics and ethics
[10.68 - 15.48]  of a hacker to break into the iPod, and we are investigating the implications of their
[15.48 - 21.44]  actions under the DMCA and other laws, Apple said. But Amazon offered the labels a lateral

[0.00 - 5.28]  software and sell your music as unprotected MP3s, which also play on iPods.
[5.28 - 11.80]  And you can start to wean your customers off the iTunes Store, or at least weaken its whip
[11.80 - 13.76]  hand over your business.
[13.76 - 15.20]  You can set your own pricing.
[15.20 - 20.32]  We'll help you with the promos, and together we can get some competition to the market,
[20.32 - 25.00]  music industry bought into it, and iTunes dropped DRM not long after.

[0.00 - 5.08]  Of course, book publishers totally missed this and happily turned their catalogs over

[13.44 - 16.44]  Chapter 1.3 So this is copy protection?
[16.44 - 21.80]  Well, if anti-circumvention hands the keys to the business to digital lock companies,
[21.80 - 25.28]  at least it stops people from making infringing copies, right?

[0.00 - 1.52]  Nope, sorry.
[1.52 - 3.12]  There's an internet meme called,
[3.12 - 5.08]  Now You've Got Two Problems.
[5.08 - 8.56]  As in, your shower broke and you decided to fix it yourself
[8.56 - 9.84]  instead of calling a plumber.
[9.84 - 10.92]  Now you've got two problems.
[10.92 - 13.02]  That's just what's about to happen
[13.02 - 15.60]  with our digital locks explanation.
[15.60 - 18.62]  You wanted to stop people from copying your file.
[18.62 - 21.60]  So you gave them a CypherTek and a player with a key hidden.
[21.60 - 25.10]  But that player decrypts the file and if your...

[0.00 - 4.48]  audience can save the file while it's decrypted, then they can start to copy it.
[4.48 - 8.08]  And now you have three problems because they can also just take your keys.
[8.08 - 13.08]  You can find those, they can just throw away your specialty and make their own.
[13.08 - 17.68]  And now you have four problems because users who figure out how to get the keys out of your
[17.68 - 21.00]  player can tell other people how to do that too.
[21.00 - 24.92]  And now you have five problems because they can also just...

[14.48 - 19.28]  Is Apple for or against digital locks? One of the world's most successful
[19.28 - 21.92]  digital lock vendors is Apple. Despite public

[5.86 - 13.38]  The popular iOS devices, the iPod, iPhone, iPad all use DRM that ensures that only software
[13.38 - 16.38]  bought through Apple's store can run on them.
