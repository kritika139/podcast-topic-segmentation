[0.00 - 5.28]  log inputs on your computer and recapture video. All of these methods are admittedly
[5.28 - 10.00]  tedious. If you really wanted to go into the lock pit, you'd have to know something about
[10.00 - 15.84]  program. The truth is that most digital locks that anyone cares about are broken in a day or two.
[15.84 - 23.76]  In 2006, a programmer who called himself Newslix64 broke the locks on a software-based HD DV. He
[23.76 - 24.96]  chose the player because...

[0.00 - 5.36]  to break. That is, it was the one with the worst security. Remember that people who attack
[5.36 - 11.84]  digital locks get to pick their targets and they generally choose back to Musilix 60. He
[11.84 - 17.60]  reasoned that while he was playing an HDDDD movie. The encryption keys must be somewhere
[17.60 - 23.36]  in his computer's memory. So he put on a movie and looked through the memory until he found the
[23.36 - 24.96]  key he wanted. After

[0.00 - 6.28]  he announced his success, another programmer, Arnazami, used Musilix 64's methods to find
[6.28 - 11.76]  a key that could be applied even more widely. The 09F9 processing key, which can be written
[11.76 - 24.96]  out as 09F9 1102 9D74 E3 5B 851 4156

[0.00 - 5.00]  C5, 63, 56, 88, C0.
[5.00 - 6.50]  That's hexadecimal.
[6.50 - 11.00]  One of the counting systems used by computer probe in decimal, the number looks like this.
[11.00 - 25.00]  13, 256, 278, 887, 989, 457, 651, 018, 865, 901, 401, 704, 642.

[0.00 - 5.68]  Once this secret was released onto the net, any skilled programmer write a program that
[5.68 - 12.40]  descramble HD DVD movies. If she so chose, she could include the option to convert HD DVDs
[12.40 - 17.68]  to unscramble video files that could be played without restrictions. And more piracy warnings,
[17.68 - 24.88]  more ads. And who could play the DVDs you bought anywhere in the world, not just on players that

[0.00 - 2.60]  came from the same country as the disk.
[2.60 - 5.36]  Muclic's 64-story is instructive.
[5.36 - 8.12]  He attacked the weakest point in the systems he did.
[8.12 - 10.32]  The whole system failed.
[10.32 - 12.40]  There was a weird Keystone cops move
[12.40 - 15.00]  when the big studios and their technology partners
[15.00 - 19.08]  tried to prevent publication of the 09 F9 key.
[19.08 - 21.64]  Every time they did, it made the news
[21.64 - 23.36]  and affronted internet users,
[23.36 - 25.16]  republished it somewhere else.

[0.00 - 3.84]  Soon, there were millions of copies of the number.
[3.84 - 12.74]  As of July 2014, Google knew of about 518,000 webpages containing the secret number.
[12.74 - 16.60]  Other keys have been discovered since the programmers routinely turn these extracted
[16.60 - 21.56]  keys into programs that automatically strip the locks off of digital files so you need
[21.56 - 25.00]  to be able to take a lock off yourself in order to accomplish this.

[0.00 - 4.96]  When a programmer writes a lock-breaking, she effectively bottles her expertise and sends
[4.96 - 5.96]  it to you.
[5.96 - 10.68]  Still, many of these lock-breaking programs are written with a technical audience in mind
[10.68 - 16.32]  and are pretty tricky to get working, though some, like the DVD-ripping program Handbrake
[16.32 - 20.84]  I mentioned earlier, rate with any commercial software for easy use.
[20.84 - 24.68]  But chances are someone has already taken care of that, too.

[0.00 - 5.04]  key is used to decrypt countless files by knowledgeable audience members eager to liberate
[5.04 - 9.44]  their media before the enforcement catches up. You can just search the internet for a
[9.44 - 16.28]  copy of the movie, book, game, or song you want. It's a safe bet that someone somewhere
[16.28 - 21.72]  is already unlocked it and put it out there for you to download. Or, as they say on the
[21.72 - 25.04]  internet, now you have 518,000.

[0.00 - 4.00]  How to Kill the Book
[4.00 - 8.72]  Copyright treats all creative works the same, needlepoint patterns and crossword puzzle clues
[8.72 - 11.56]  get the same protection that video games and blockbuster.
[11.56 - 17.24]  But books aren't like books are old, much older than copyright, older than property,
[17.24 - 18.44]  older than markets.
[18.44 - 23.16]  We have a particular reverence for books in our society, one that borders on superstition
[23.16 - 25.16]  in a movie and you want to demonstrate that.



===== block_015.txt =====
[0.00 - 4.22]  our world's been reduced to barbarism, you could just show a gang of angry townsfolk
[4.22 - 10.86]  releasing books. Destroying a book has some of the same emotional tenor as eating a dog.
[10.86 - 14.98]  After all, both books and dogs have been loyal companions and indispensable service to the
[14.98 - 22.10]  human race. We know what the traditional book-bought books can be shelved, treasure lent, passed
[22.10 - 24.98]  on. Books belong to the people who acquire them.

[0.00 - 4.44]  but they are also a responsibility, something to be curated and looked at.
[4.44 - 8.68]  This sentimental attachment is of incalculable value to publishing in,
[8.68 - 13.52]  which sells innumerable books to people who merely want to display them for status,
[13.52 - 16.68]  or who feel that owning books is the right thing to do.
[16.68 - 20.92]  The digital lock on a book says that you're not the book's owner,
[20.92 - 24.88]  merely its licensor, whose rights are set out in a long,

[0.00 - 5.60]  comprehensible license. You have to click for parting. Most people understandably pretend
[5.60 - 9.84]  it's a matter and that the ownership term continued to be bound by the social contract
[9.84 - 15.44]  that stretches back to the Roman Empire. Good thing, too. If publishers do succeed in convincing
[15.44 - 20.56]  readers that books are just like CDs and ease, then the sight of a book in a shredder will
[20.56 - 24.80]  no more emotional kick than the sight of an old, scratched CD.

[0.00 - 7.60]  in the gutter and publishers who's all the social value they currently get.
[7.60 - 9.68]  Speed bumps and honest use.
[9.68 - 13.56]  If you ask companies why they bother with digital locks when they're so easy to overcome,
[13.56 - 18.64]  they say things like, speed bumps don't prevent you from speeding, they get harder to speed.
[18.64 - 20.72]  This is a digital speed bump.
[20.72 - 23.16]  Fortunately for them, the evidence doesn't bear out the truth.
[23.16 - 25.00]  Big Champagne is a medium metrics comes in.

[0.00 - 5.12]  usage statistics for file sharing. Back when iTunes required digital locks and all its music,
[5.12 - 9.24]  the big champagne folks decided to show how long it took for a song to go from iTunes
[9.24 - 14.48]  to the file sharing. They chose a song that had an early iTunes-only release to exclude
[14.48 - 18.64]  songs that were being ripped from unlocked CDs and measured a lot. They reported that
[18.64 - 23.84]  the net time between the release of a song with a digital lock and the appearance of
[23.84 - 25.00]  the same song on iTunes.



===== block_016.txt =====
[0.00 - 3.68]  locked on file sharing services, three minutes.
[4.40 - 8.64]  This 182nd gap represented the maximum time that a potential
[8.64 - 11.64]  customer would have to wait before he could get a free copy of
[11.64 - 14.36]  the song in question, complete with all the freedoms and
[14.36 - 16.92]  permissions that had been locked out by it.
[17.12 - 21.00]  The rejoinder to this from digital walk advocates is that
[21.00 - 24.32]  even if their technology can't deter lawbreakers, it can still
[24.32 - 25.00]  keep on.

[0.00 - 4.84]  This user is honest and wants to do the rightful act of telling his people to fail to do so.
[4.84 - 9.20]  But as the eminent computer scientist Ed Felton, a professor at Princeton and formerly the
[9.20 - 13.48]  chief technologist of the Federal Trade Commission once quipped, nothing needs to be done to
[13.48 - 18.48]  keep honest people honest, just as nothing needs to be done to keep tall people tall.
[18.48 - 24.08]  If this is all a digital act can claim to do, then it's not doing very much at all.
[24.08 - 25.00]  Sometimes things get even worse.

[0.00 - 2.56]  muddier. Every three years, the U.S. Copyright Office
[2.56 - 5.10]  entertains proposals for exemptions to its digital
[5.10 - 8.04]  lock rules. In 2010, the Copyright Office granted
[8.04 - 10.24]  Americans permission to break the digital locks on
[10.24 - 14.38]  their iPhones, but not their iPods or iPads, ruling
[14.38 - 17.98]  that jail-breaking, a phone after purchase, constituted
[17.98 - 21.28]  fair use. However, this permission doesn't legitimize
[21.28 - 24.36]  the creation or dissemination of tools to accomplish
[24.36 - 25.02]  the task.

[0.00 - 5.16]  It only confers on each user the right to discover a vulnerability in their iPhone,
[5.16 - 10.20]  figure out how to bootstrap that vulnerability into a jailbreak, and then use it.
[10.20 - 13.76]  It doesn't permit you to tell anyone else about the approach you took,
[13.76 - 17.44]  and it certainly doesn't permit you to jailbreak someone else's iPhone,
[17.44 - 20.24]  or distribute a tool that does it for them.
[20.24 - 24.88]  It's the equipment of legalizing heroin use, but not production or sale.

[0.00 - 4.08]  If you can magically make heroin appear out of thin air, you're allowed to inject it.
[4.08 - 8.64]  Otherwise, you're still stuck illegally buying unknown substances from criminals
[8.64 - 10.24]  and injecting them into your body.
[12.40 - 13.36]  Watermarking
[13.36 - 17.52]  Some digital lock companies have promised to solve their problems with watermark.
[17.52 - 23.20]  They propose to embed imperceptible signals in video and audio and even text that computers can
[23.20 - 24.96]  search for, confirming that a file



===== block_017.txt =====
[0.00 - 4.64]  is in the hands of the owner. A movie would thus be watermarked with its owner's information,
[4.64 - 11.44]  saying effectively, I am Corey Doctorow's copy of Star Wars. If a DVD player that isn't registered
[11.44 - 17.12]  or a doctor or play the movie, it's locked out. Or, alternatively, companies could look on file
[17.12 - 22.40]  sharing sites for illicit copies of their movies, use watermarks to figure out whom these copies
[22.40 - 24.80]  originated with and sue or black.

[0.00 - 2.50]  or otherwise punish that person.
[2.50 - 5.42]  Or maybe they could simply use the watermarked player
[5.42 - 8.88]  was found to be weak enough to allow their locks to be removed.
[8.88 - 12.58]  And future media could be made inaccessible to that model.
[12.58 - 15.82]  All of these solutions are rife with problems.
[15.82 - 17.46]  You can disallow some players,
[17.46 - 19.66]  but you can't stop coders from writing and distributing
[19.66 - 20.82]  their own playback pro.
[20.82 - 23.06]  You'd also have a hard time finding a judge
[23.06 - 25.06]  who'd convict someone of copyright.

[0.00 - 5.00]  because the media originally sold to them was now available elsewhere.
[5.00 - 11.00]  You'd have to prove that they released the files themselves rather than say that they lost their laptop
[11.00 - 17.00]  or sold it or lost it in a divorce or gave it to their children or had it stolen.
[17.00 - 20.00]  Finally, there's the big technical problem.
[20.00 - 25.00]  A watermark can't be truly imperceptible unless you also want it to be used.

[0.00 - 1.00]  This is useless.
[1.00 - 5.04]  Imagine a photo with the words copyright Corey Doctorow written in letters that couldn't
[5.04 - 7.04]  be seen without a powerful microscope.
[7.04 - 10.96]  A copy of the photo without the copyright would appear functionally identical to the
[10.96 - 14.24]  copyright unless you went to great lengths to inspect it.
[14.24 - 18.16]  Of course, you could write copyright Corey Doctorow across the photo in 4-inch black
[18.16 - 22.52]  letters, but you could have a hard time selling a photo like that.
[22.52 - 28.52]  Watermarkers have tried to ground, but that leads to a lot of confusion.

[0.00 - 5.52]  their work exposed. People who want to remove watermarks can just get two or more copies in the
[5.52 - 10.48]  file, compare them, bite by bite, look for the bites that are different in each file,
[10.48 - 17.12]  and scramble those job done. Ed Felton mentioned earlier, once assembled a team of researchers
[17.12 - 22.08]  that looked at the difficulty of removing the secured digital music initiative watermark,
[22.08 - 25.12]  the product of the most ambitious and expensive
