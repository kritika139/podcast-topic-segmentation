[0.00 - 7.00]  expensive watermarking project ever undertaken, figured out how to do it.
[8.20 - 10.40]  Chapter 1.5
[10.40 - 11.40]  Understanding General Purpose
[11.40 - 15.72]  Back at the dawn of mechanical computation, computers were special purpose.
[15.72 - 21.40]  One computer would solve one kind of mathematical problem, but during World War II, thanks to
[21.40 - 25.00]  the government funded advancements made by such scientific luminary

[0.00 - 6.96]  as Alan Turing and John von Neumann, a new kind of new existence, the general purpose digital.
[6.96 - 11.20]  These machines arose from a theory of general purpose computation that showed that with a
[11.20 - 16.56]  simple set of logic gates and enough memory and time, you could compute any program that could
[16.56 - 22.32]  be represented symbolically. That is, general purpose computers are machines capable of running
[22.32 - 24.72]  every valid program you can write.

[0.00 - 3.44]  This principle gave birth to the modern computer as we understand it.
[3.44 - 7.80]  It suggests that all computers are equivalent on a fundamental level.
[7.80 - 12.72]  Any computational task can run on any computer, though some computers might take trillions
[12.72 - 14.64]  of years to run the whole program.
[14.64 - 16.96]  It's nearly miraculous this business.
[16.96 - 20.72]  Until the middle of the last century, most computers were purpose-built to compute in
[20.72 - 22.52]  one particular way.
[22.52 - 25.00]  Today we can and do routine...

[0.00 - 6.60]  we make computers that can compute in every describable way. Our world is made up of general
[6.60 - 11.22]  purpose computers. This is the major reason that digital locks have been dead on arrival
[11.22 - 15.84]  since their first and why they continue to fail. We know how to build a computer that
[15.84 - 20.12]  can solve one kind of problem like the adding machine and we know how to build a computer
[20.12 - 24.76]  that can solve all kinds of things. But we don't know how to design and build a computer

[0.00 - 6.48]  that can run every program except one program that pisses off endangers or harms the entertainment
[6.48 - 12.16]  in them. The computer that runs everything minus one has no basis in theory. Maybe some
[12.16 - 16.32]  21st century Alan Turing will invent it, but no one has yet stepped forward with such a
[16.32 - 21.32]  design. And the consensus of computer science is that such a design is not feasible, which
[21.32 - 25.00]  means that we can't deliver on the promise of digital law.

[0.00 - 4.28]  Of course, that hasn't stopped the entertainment industry from trying to approximate the effect
[4.28 - 7.28]  of a computer that doesn't run a certain program.
[7.28 - 8.64]  And that's where the trouble is.
[8.64 - 12.44]  Instead of building computers that are incapable of running a program that makes copies of
[12.44 - 18.84]  files that shouldn't be copied, we make computers that are designed to run all programs.
[18.84 - 23.92]  Then we add software that watches what that computer's user does at all times and that
[23.92 - 25.00]  secretly kills.

[0.00 - 5.44]  any process, a program that does something the entertainment industry doesn't like.
[5.44 - 10.64]  As a rule, computer owners don't want their computers to disobey their orders.
[10.64 - 15.04]  From the owner's perspective, a computer that won't make copies when you want it to
[15.04 - 20.48]  is broken, so digital locks need to be designed for stealth as well as vigilance.
[20.48 - 24.88]  They need to disguise themselves from users and hide their workings from the operating

[0.00 - 6.08]  There's only one class of programs that behaves this way, hiding itself from users and doing
[6.08 - 8.56]  things that users don't want.
[8.56 - 9.56]  Spyware.
[9.56 - 15.44]  Chapter 1.6 Root Kits Every.
[15.44 - 20.32]  The major strategy behind spyware and anti-copying software is called a root kit.
[20.32 - 24.44]  Root kits are programs that covertly modify a computer's operating to blind it to certain
[24.44 - 25.44]  files.

[0.00 - 5.36]  process. Once a computer has been compromised by a root kit, it will not see the files associated
[5.36 - 10.32]  with the malicious software it can seal. If you open a folder containing a malicious program on
[10.32 - 15.36]  a root kit infected computer, the program won't be visible in the folder's listing. Nor will you
[15.36 - 20.40]  be able to see any of the processes associated with that program. If you go to your computer's
[20.40 - 24.88]  process mod utility that lists all the programs on your computer, the malicious program

[0.00 - 3.76]  will not appear on the list, even if it's running.
[3.76 - 5.36]  It's useful to think of this in terms
[5.36 - 7.00]  of your own immune system.
[7.00 - 9.60]  A healthy immune system is capable of recognizing
[9.60 - 11.92]  and categorizing the stuff in your body.
[11.92 - 14.20]  When your immune system is working well,
[14.20 - 16.96]  it can distinguish between help of gut bacteria,
[16.96 - 20.88]  toxic infectious bacteria inhabiting a cut on your hand,
[20.88 - 22.68]  and your own cells.
[22.68 - 25.08]  Autoimmune disorders occur when your immune system



===== block_020.txt =====
[0.00 - 4.56]  gets confused. Sometimes your immune system will erroneously identify your own body as
[4.56 - 10.58]  a harmful foreign agent and attack it, causing anything from mild allergies to horrific and
[10.58 - 15.74]  fading outbreaks. On the other hand, sometimes your immune system stops being able to combat
[15.74 - 20.62]  harmful organisms and lets them multiply without interference. This is what happens when pneumonia
[20.62 - 25.02]  brings immune systems and being compromised by HIV. It's not a coincidence that's

[0.00 - 6.68]  spyware and digital locks use the same root kit techniques. In 2005, Sony BMG
[6.68 - 12.24]  shipped 6 million audio CDs loaded with a secret root kit that covertly
[12.24 - 17.32]  installed itself when you inserted one of these CDs into your computer. Once your
[17.32 - 23.20]  computer had been compromised, any file that began with string sys string was
[23.20 - 26.88]  invisible to the op...

[0.00 - 7.28]  So, a file called string-sys-string-rootkit.exe wouldn't show up when you looked in the folder
[7.28 - 8.84]  containing it.
[8.84 - 15.00]  And when that program ran, string-sys-string-rootkit.exe wouldn't be listed in the process.
[15.00 - 19.82]  The Sony rootkit was used to cloak a program that watched for and then killed attempts
[19.82 - 22.84]  to copy music off of audio CDs from the users.
[22.84 - 25.00]  It looked like your computer had suddenly developed a system.

[0.00 - 3.84]  serious bug that stopped CD ripping software from running.
[3.84 - 6.68]  This is the equivalent of an autoimmune allergy.
[6.68 - 11.92]  The computer's owner has a process that she wants to run a CD copying process, but the
[11.92 - 17.24]  computer erroneously identifies that program as undesirable and kills it every time it
[17.24 - 20.84]  tries to start, but it didn't stop there.
[20.84 - 24.96]  Once there were millions of computers in the wild that couldn't see files that started

[0.00 - 7.00]  string-siss-string, virus writers started to add string-siss-string to the names of their programs too.
[7.00 - 12.00]  This was the digital equivalent of H. Your computer could no longer detect bad programs
[12.00 - 17.00]  because it had had a gaping hole punched through the middle of its immune system.
[17.00 - 22.00]  Any program that adopted the protective coloration of Sony's anti-copying tool
[22.00 - 25.00]  could cloak itself in Sony's root kit.
