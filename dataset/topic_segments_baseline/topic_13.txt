[0.00 - 6.00]  Now imagine that it was illegal to tell anyone about the way that system worked.
[6.00 - 8.00]  That's the world we're living in.
[10.00 - 12.00]  Back to the WCT.
[12.00 - 15.00]  At the start of this chapter, I wrote that the WCT created the digital law
[15.00 - 20.00]  for the nations of the world of domestic law with small variations from state to state.
[20.00 - 25.00]  But the truth is, most nations have followed the lead of the U.S. in going much further.

[0.00 - 6.08]  to the WCT requires. The WCT calls for laws against breaking a law to commit an act of
[6.08 - 12.36]  copyright of DNCA here in the US makes it illegal to break digital locks, period. Other
[12.36 - 17.88]  countries around the world have followed suit, often at the open explicit urging of the Office
[17.88 - 22.80]  of the US Trade Representative and lobbyists from the US entertainment industry, which
[22.80 - 24.80]  means that the problem is even.

[0.00 - 6.20]  worse than the WCT suggestion.
[6.20 - 8.80]  Chapter 1.9, Worse Than Nothing.
[8.80 - 13.52]  The technical implausibility and unintended consequences of digital locks are big problems
[13.52 - 15.20]  for digital lock makers.
[15.20 - 19.32]  But we're more interested in what digital locks do to creators and their investors,
[19.32 - 24.60]  and there's one important harm we need to discuss before we move on.

[0.00 - 3.20]  turn paying customers to pirates.
[3.20 - 6.60]  One thing we know about audiences is that they aren't very interested in hearing
[6.60 - 10.70]  excuses about why they can't buy the media they want, when they want it,
[10.70 - 12.96]  in the format they want to buy it in.
[12.96 - 17.32]  Study after study shows that overseas downloading of US TV shows drops off
[17.32 - 20.72]  sharply when those shows are put on the air internationally.
[20.72 - 24.76]  That is, people just want to watch the TV their pals are talking about on the internet.

[0.00 - 5.44]  pay for it if it's for sale, but if it's not, they'll just get it for free. Walking
[5.44 - 10.40]  users out doesn't reduce downloads, it reduces sales.
[10.40 - 16.64]  The first person to publish a program to break the digital locks on old-style DVDs in 1999
[16.64 - 23.64]  was Jhon Lech Johansson, a 15-year-old Norwegian teenager. DVD Jhon took up the project because

[4.16 - 8.32]  in order to watch the DVDs he bought, he had to break their locks.
[8.32 - 15.28]  Seven years later, Muslic64 broke HDDVD's DRM for similar reasons. He wanted to watch a legitimate
[15.28 - 21.20]  out-of-region DVD that he'd purchased. Both of these seminal figures in the history of digital
[21.20 - 24.96]  locks were inspired not by piracy, but by frustration.

[0.00 - 4.00]  the limits put on the legitimate media they'd paid good money for.
[4.00 - 10.70]  In 2007, NBC and Apple had a contract with the speed over the terms of sale for Apple's iTunes store.
[10.70 - 14.50]  NBC's material was withdrawn from iTunes for about nine months.
[14.50 - 20.80]  In 2008, researchers from Carnegie Mellon University released a paper investigating the file sharing of this blackout,
[20.80 - 23.80]  converting pirates without cannibalizing purchasers.
[23.80 - 25.00]  The impact of...

[0.00 - 4.98]  digital distribution on physical sales and internet piracy they found was that the contract
[4.98 - 11.34]  dispute resulted in a spike of downloads on pirate sites and not just of NBC material.
[11.34 - 15.56]  It seemed that once people who had been in the habit of buying their shows on iTunes
[15.56 - 21.08]  found their way onto the free-for-all file sharing sites, they clicked on everything
[21.08 - 25.04]  that looked interesting. Downloads of NBC shows went up a lot and down

[0.00 - 4.72]  downloads of everything else went up a little more interesting is what happened after the
[4.72 - 10.64]  NBC Apple dispute ended and the show's return to iTunes as the CMU paper showed, download
[10.64 - 15.84]  rates for those shows stayed higher than they had been before the blackout.
[15.84 - 20.32]  That is, fusing to sell their viewers the content they wanted in the format they preferred drove
[20.32 - 22.44]  those viewers to piracy.
[22.44 - 24.92]  Once the audience started pirating the content they wanted...

[0.00 - 5.12]  they quickly turned to pirating other content too. Having become aware of and proficient
[5.12 - 11.52]  in downloading, the audience developed a downloading habit that outlasted the end of the blackout.
[11.52 - 15.92]  Digital lock vendors will tell you that their wares aren't perfect, but they're better than nothing.
[16.48 - 21.92]  But the evidence is that digital locks are much worse. Industries that make widespread use of
[21.92 - 24.88]  digital locks see market powers shifting from creators and investors.
