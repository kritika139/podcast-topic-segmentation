[0.00 - 4.56]  for scrambling. These algorithms are usually public and well understood, because no one
[4.56 - 9.06]  is ever sure if an algorithm is secure until all her peers get a chance to look at it and
[9.06 - 14.24]  check it over her flaws. Third, there's the key, a secret password that's fed into the
[14.24 - 19.72]  algorithm along clear text in order to produce the scrambled file. This scrambled file,
[19.72 - 25.00]  the fourth thing is called the ciphered and in that state it's an indecipherable mess.

[0.00 - 5.52]  of no value to anyone unless they have the key to scramble it. People can copy this encrypted
[5.52 - 11.12]  file all they want and it won't ever substitute for the legit product because it's indistinguishable
[11.12 - 16.64]  from random noise. With the algorithm works, the file can't be unscrambled unless you have that key.
[17.20 - 23.04]  With a digital lock, the player, the Kindle, the DVD player, a software program that plays or

[0.00 - 5.68]  a copy of the secret key embedded in it. You load the ciphertext file on the player,
[5.68 - 10.48]  it unscrambles the file and lets you see the clear text, and then it throws the clear text
[10.48 - 13.92]  away when you're done.
[13.92 - 18.08]  How Compatibility Works If you've been using computers for a long time,
[18.08 - 23.16]  you probably remember where there were multiple incompatible ways of creating documents. You'd
[23.16 - 25.00]  send someone your Apple Work spreadsheet.

[0.00 - 2.94]  sheet, and they'd complain that they only had Excel.
[2.94 - 6.48]  You'd send them a Word document, and they'd only have Word perfect.
[6.48 - 10.16]  Over time, this ceased to be a problem, mostly because these programs started
[10.16 - 14.28]  including an automatic feature for reading and writing each other's files.
[14.28 - 16.32]  At first, this was complicated.
[16.32 - 18.36]  You'd try to open a word processor in your program,
[18.36 - 21.76]  would ask you if you wanted it converted from some obscure file for
[21.76 - 24.00]  the one your program could understand.
[24.00 - 24.96]  Then it became automatic.

[0.00 - 6.00]  you've stopped asking and just automatically you fed it converting as need be. Likewise,
[6.00 - 12.08]  in the early days of web browsers, there were lots of warring graphics, a whole acronym salads work,
[12.08 - 21.60]  GIF, JPEG, PNG, SVG, BMP. Depending on the page you visited and the browser you get little red X's
[21.60 - 26.88]  or error messages telling you your browser wasn't compatible.

[0.00 - 5.92]  someone's animated dancing hamster image. But today, your browser just reads and displays
[5.92 - 12.32]  all those files without batting an iRidge. What happened? Well, programmers made them compatible
[12.32 - 17.76]  with the other format. This is something that is very hard to do in the physical world. Making
[17.76 - 23.76]  your toaster compatible with a dishwasher isn't a project for the faint of heart. But it's routine
[23.76 - 24.80]  in the digital world.

[0.00 - 2.62]  not where digital locks are concerned.
[2.62 - 4.82]  Here's where the problem for creators and investors,
[4.82 - 7.02]  because anti-circumvention rules mean
[7.02 - 9.90]  that only a digital locks maker can authorize you
[9.90 - 10.82]  to open it.
[10.82 - 13.90]  On-the-fly conversions to improve compatibility
[13.90 - 15.66]  often aren't allowed.
[15.66 - 19.18]  That's how copyright ceases to protect creative works
[19.18 - 22.38]  and begins to protect digital locks instead.

[0.00 - 6.92]  Chapter 1.2. Is this copyright protection? The people who make digital locks sell them
[6.92 - 12.96]  as copy protection. That is, protection against having problems, sometimes as copyright protect.
[12.96 - 17.48]  We can debate their claim to the former, but we should certainly reject the idea that digital
[17.48 - 22.36]  locks protect copyright. As things stand now, it's the other way around. Many different
[22.36 - 25.00]  reasons and rationales for copyright have been offered.

[0.00 - 6.56]  since its inception. The English Statute of Anne of 1710 set out to protect the established English
[6.56 - 12.32]  publishers from Scottish competition. Sixty-some years later, the U.S. Constitution provided for
[12.32 - 18.32]  copyright to promote the progress of science and useful arts. The Berne Convention for the Protection
[18.32 - 23.68]  of Artistic and Literary Works, one of the first international copyright agreements, its text was
[23.68 - 27.76]  based on draft created by the U.S. Constitutional Authority.

[0.00 - 5.84]  by Victor Hugo and M.D.A. added protection of an author's moral rights, the right to claim
[5.84 - 11.20]  authorship of a work for and to prevent its distortion or modification. One rationale that
[11.20 - 17.20]  has never is that copyright exists to protect middlemen, retailers, and distributors from
[17.20 - 22.72]  being out negotiated by creators and their investors. Now, let's say there's a company with a wildly
[22.72 - 24.88]  popular video distribution of filmmaker,



===== block_006.txt =====
[0.00 - 4.22]  they'll sell your movies and give you 70% of the revenue and even better
[4.22 - 9.86]  They'll promise you that they'll keep your movies safe from piracy by putting their digital locks on them at first
[10.16 - 14.84]  Everything's great. You're making money. They're making you sell a million
[14.84 - 22.78]  Five million ten million then they squeeze on the 3070 split was just an introductory now that they proven out great
[22.78 - 24.78]  Their technology is they want it

[0.00 - 7.30]  At the current rate of sale, that means you'll be giving them millions of dollars every month.
[7.30 - 12.30]  Money you were putting back into your own business, using to create more art, using to pay your
[12.30 - 13.46]  own overhead.
[13.46 - 16.02]  Without anti-circumvention, this is easy.
[16.02 - 20.10]  You just call a meeting with the video distributor and say, no deal.
[20.10 - 23.78]  First of all, there are plenty of other operators out there who can do what you do.
[23.78 - 24.78]  You're the distributor.
[24.78 - 25.78]  You're just a distributor.

[0.00 - 5.68]  job is to provide invisible commodity plumbing that puts our movies in front of our audience.
[5.68 - 9.92]  Second of all, for the money you're talking about, we could just skip the middleman and
[9.92 - 16.20]  build our own system. So, yeah, no deal. It's your copyright. You have all the negotiating
[16.20 - 23.08]  footage. But this works only if your audience can follow you from the old 40 new ones. If
[23.08 - 25.08]  I'm your audience and I spent a thousand...

[0.00 - 3.56]  In my movie library, I don't want to have the investment.
[3.56 - 9.68]  I want to be able to use one family of devices and one program to manage my movies.
[9.68 - 15.32]  I'm not going to try to remember which movie goes with which player and which device, and
[15.32 - 22.24]  I'm certainly not going to get a new box under my TV just for your movies, let alone a new
[22.24 - 23.44]  TV.

[0.00 - 5.20]  circumvention to the mix, all of copyright's protection is handed directly to the company
[5.20 - 11.04]  that slapped a digital lock on the product. The filmmaker can't authorize audiences to break
[11.04 - 17.28]  those locks and convert their movies to play on a new device. The investor can't authorize that
[17.28 - 23.36]  either. Only the distributor has the right to allow this. The distributor who stands to lose
[23.36 - 24.88]  everything if it happens.

[0.00 - 4.96]  Here's another snippet. Imagine for a moment that every book you bought at Walmart could be
[4.96 - 10.88]  shelved only on a bookcase from Walmart. The books were designed with some kind of little divot
[10.88 - 16.96]  in the spine so that they could sit flat only on a Walmart shelf and printed with a special ink
[16.96 - 22.48]  that glowed only under a Walmart light bulb and only when held at a special angle you could attain
[22.48 - 24.88]  only by sitting in a specially designed Walmart.

[0.00 - 6.36]  Every time you sold a $10 book through Walmart, that would be $10 worth of investment in this
[6.36 - 12.00]  Walmart ecosystem your readers would feel beholden to, even if you and all their other
[12.00 - 16.48]  favorite authors would later offer a better deal at Barnes & Noble.
[16.48 - 20.48]  Meanwhile, you'd only get 50 cents of that $10 royalties if that.
[20.48 - 23.48]  It's easy to understand why Walmart loves this.
[23.48 - 25.00]  It creates a winner takes all money.

[4.60 - 10.60]  The question is, why should authors or publishers want to have anything to do with a scheme
[10.60 - 11.60]  like that?
[11.60 - 13.36]  Digital locks are Roche Motel.
[13.36 - 16.84]  Copyrighted works check in, but they don't check out.
[16.84 - 19.44]  Creators and investors lose control of their business.

[5.72 - 11.28]  world, learned this the hard way in 2000. Amazon demanded a deeper wholesale discount
[11.28 - 16.96]  on Ashet. Amazon retaliated by blacking out many Ashet titles on its site, including books
[16.96 - 22.84]  by best sellers like JK Rowling, either marking them as unavailable or on backorder, and even
[22.84 - 25.04]  suggesting books by other public...

[4.34 - 10.10]  A'Shatt, the most fervent digital lock advocate in the publishing world, was reduced to offering
[10.10 - 13.06]  scolding comments in retaliation.
[13.06 - 16.82]  If it hadn't been for the locks in the A'Shatt titles, the company would have had a much
[16.82 - 21.34]  more fearsome weapon at its disposal when it came to its Kindle titles.

[11.44 - 17.02]  spend the rest of it at Archive, Archive.org. An amazing public library. Brewster tells
[17.02 - 21.12]  a famous story about life in the shadow of Microsoft during the heyday of the packaged

[11.76 - 17.20]  software creators, who wrote Windows program. The Software Vendors Association also spent a lot
[17.20 - 21.52]  of time warning programmers about the risks of piracy and the problems they'd have with their
[21.52 - 24.96]  customers deciding to copy them into the courthouse. This served to

[0.00 - 4.00]  still more creative, which was meant to provide a shield against this threat.
[4.00 - 9.00]  But then Microsoft started to undercut the same companies that had trusted its platform.
