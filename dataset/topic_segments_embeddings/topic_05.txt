[0.00 - 6.12]  Music stores that signed up one or two labels each and distributed music using their own digital locks
[6.64 - 8.64]  No one liked these stores very much
[9.00 - 16.82]  Then Apple created the first iPod in 2001 and went around to the labels and said look these things only work with max
[16.98 - 24.80]  Because they require an obscure cable port called firewire. That's only five percent of the market. Why don't you try and experiment?

[0.00 - 3.44]  and the iTunes store with music from all the big labels.
[3.44 - 7.12]  The experiment turned out to be successful, so successful,
[7.12 - 12.24]  that the labels didn't dare pull out when the iPod started to work with Windows as well.
[12.24 - 15.04]  But Apple had lots of rules about selling music.
[15.04 - 17.68]  You couldn't buy the kind of promotion that the labels wanted,
[17.68 - 21.92]  and you could sell songs for only one price, 99 cents.
[21.92 - 24.88]  The labels hated this. Apple wouldn't bud-

[0.00 - 4.00]  The labels came to realize that they've been caught in yet another Roche motel.
[4.00 - 8.00]  Their customers had bought millions of dollars worth of Apple-locked music,
[8.00 - 13.00]  and if the labels left the iTunes store, the listeners would be hard-pressed to follow them.
[13.00 - 18.00]  Just to make this very clear, Apple threatened a competitor, Real Networks,
[18.00 - 25.00]  when Real released a version of its player that allowed users to load digitally-locked songs bought from the Real...

[0.00 - 5.88]  player store onto an iPod, enabling customers to play both Reels and Apple's music on
[5.88 - 10.68]  the same device. We are stunned that Reel Networks has adopted the tactics and ethics
[10.68 - 15.48]  of a hacker to break into the iPod, and we are investigating the implications of their
[15.48 - 21.44]  actions under the DMCA and other laws, Apple said. But Amazon offered the labels a lateral
[21.44 - 24.96]  Give up on digital rights management, DRMs.

[0.00 - 5.28]  software and sell your music as unprotected MP3s, which also play on iPods.
[5.28 - 11.80]  And you can start to wean your customers off the iTunes Store, or at least weaken its whip
[11.80 - 13.76]  hand over your business.
[13.76 - 15.20]  You can set your own pricing.
[15.20 - 20.32]  We'll help you with the promos, and together we can get some competition to the market,
[20.32 - 25.00]  music industry bought into it, and iTunes dropped DRM not long after.
