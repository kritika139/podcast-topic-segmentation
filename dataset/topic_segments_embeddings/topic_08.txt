[0.00 - 5.28]  log inputs on your computer and recapture video. All of these methods are admittedly
[5.28 - 10.00]  tedious. If you really wanted to go into the lock pit, you'd have to know something about
[10.00 - 15.84]  program. The truth is that most digital locks that anyone cares about are broken in a day or two.
[15.84 - 23.76]  In 2006, a programmer who called himself Newslix64 broke the locks on a software-based HD DV. He
[23.76 - 24.96]  chose the player because...

[0.00 - 5.36]  to break. That is, it was the one with the worst security. Remember that people who attack
[5.36 - 11.84]  digital locks get to pick their targets and they generally choose back to Musilix 60. He
[11.84 - 17.60]  reasoned that while he was playing an HDDDD movie. The encryption keys must be somewhere
[17.60 - 23.36]  in his computer's memory. So he put on a movie and looked through the memory until he found the
[23.36 - 24.96]  key he wanted. After

[0.00 - 6.28]  he announced his success, another programmer, Arnazami, used Musilix 64's methods to find
[6.28 - 11.76]  a key that could be applied even more widely. The 09F9 processing key, which can be written
[11.76 - 24.96]  out as 09F9 1102 9D74 E3 5B 851 4156

[0.00 - 5.00]  C5, 63, 56, 88, C0.
[5.00 - 6.50]  That's hexadecimal.
[6.50 - 11.00]  One of the counting systems used by computer probe in decimal, the number looks like this.
[11.00 - 25.00]  13, 256, 278, 887, 989, 457, 651, 018, 865, 901, 401, 704, 642.

[0.00 - 5.68]  Once this secret was released onto the net, any skilled programmer write a program that
[5.68 - 12.40]  descramble HD DVD movies. If she so chose, she could include the option to convert HD DVDs
[12.40 - 17.68]  to unscramble video files that could be played without restrictions. And more piracy warnings,
[17.68 - 24.88]  more ads. And who could play the DVDs you bought anywhere in the world, not just on players that

[0.00 - 2.60]  came from the same country as the disk.
[2.60 - 5.36]  Muclic's 64-story is instructive.
[5.36 - 8.12]  He attacked the weakest point in the systems he did.
[8.12 - 10.32]  The whole system failed.
[10.32 - 12.40]  There was a weird Keystone cops move
[12.40 - 15.00]  when the big studios and their technology partners
[15.00 - 19.08]  tried to prevent publication of the 09 F9 key.
[19.08 - 21.64]  Every time they did, it made the news
[21.64 - 23.36]  and affronted internet users,
[23.36 - 25.16]  republished it somewhere else.

[0.00 - 3.84]  Soon, there were millions of copies of the number.
[3.84 - 12.74]  As of July 2014, Google knew of about 518,000 webpages containing the secret number.
[12.74 - 16.60]  Other keys have been discovered since the programmers routinely turn these extracted
[16.60 - 21.56]  keys into programs that automatically strip the locks off of digital files so you need
[21.56 - 25.00]  to be able to take a lock off yourself in order to accomplish this.

[0.00 - 4.96]  When a programmer writes a lock-breaking, she effectively bottles her expertise and sends
[4.96 - 5.96]  it to you.
[5.96 - 10.68]  Still, many of these lock-breaking programs are written with a technical audience in mind
[10.68 - 16.32]  and are pretty tricky to get working, though some, like the DVD-ripping program Handbrake
[16.32 - 20.84]  I mentioned earlier, rate with any commercial software for easy use.
[20.84 - 24.68]  But chances are someone has already taken care of that, too.

[0.00 - 5.04]  key is used to decrypt countless files by knowledgeable audience members eager to liberate
[5.04 - 9.44]  their media before the enforcement catches up. You can just search the internet for a
[9.44 - 16.28]  copy of the movie, book, game, or song you want. It's a safe bet that someone somewhere
[16.28 - 21.72]  is already unlocked it and put it out there for you to download. Or, as they say on the
[21.72 - 25.04]  internet, now you have 518,000.

[0.00 - 4.00]  How to Kill the Book
[4.00 - 8.72]  Copyright treats all creative works the same, needlepoint patterns and crossword puzzle clues
[8.72 - 11.56]  get the same protection that video games and blockbuster.
[11.56 - 17.24]  But books aren't like books are old, much older than copyright, older than property,
[17.24 - 18.44]  older than markets.
[18.44 - 23.16]  We have a particular reverence for books in our society, one that borders on superstition
[23.16 - 25.16]  in a movie and you want to demonstrate that.
