[0.00 - 6.00]  phones had shipped with a commercial root kit called Carrier IQ. Carrier IQ bills itself
[6.00 - 10.56]  as a tool for monitoring and improving mobile network performance by gathering statistics
[10.56 - 16.36]  about dropped calls, signal streams, and so on. But as Eckhart demonstrated, Carrier IQ
[16.36 - 21.00]  could do much more on your password than on your phone's keyboard, with your text message
[21.00 - 25.08]  and pinpoint and transmit for location. When Eckhart published his findings,

[0.00 - 5.44]  the carriers performed the classic deny-threatened-down-play tactics, first denying that they'd done
[5.44 - 11.60]  anything wrong, then threatening to sue, then finally sheepishly admitting they're wrong and
[11.60 - 17.28]  apologizing. As this little soap opera was unfolding, the iPhone hacker known as CH Pone used what had
[17.28 - 23.12]  been discovered about carrier IQ to go hunting for it on iPhones, which run iOS, the closed up
[23.12 - 25.12]  rival to the mostly open.

[0.00 - 5.84]  and Android operating. CHPone was able to ascertain that carrier IQ was present on iOS too. Ultimately,
[5.84 - 15.44]  it emerged that over 141 million handsets in the United States had been infected with the carrier
[15.44 - 22.40]  IQ root kit by the carriers themselves without the knowledge or consent of the phones owner.
[22.40 - 24.88]  The important lesson here, apart from the fact, tell

[0.00 - 5.44]  coasts are lying even scum, is that it's easier to spot shenanigans in open systems and closed
[5.44 - 9.52]  systems. It's not a coincidence that the Android Revolution date that's just starting up an item
[9.52 - 15.28]  OSOther, a carrier and manufacturer, is illegal. And security researchers who publish material
[15.28 - 20.56]  about the iPhone's workings face legal jeopardy, as do their publishers, employers, and academic
[20.56 - 24.88]  institutions. The digital lock rules on the BMCA make it illegal to...

[0.00 - 5.12]  figure out how to install your own OS on an iPhone and prohibit publishing any information
[5.12 - 10.20]  that would help someone else do the same. Developers, who are allowed some limited transparency
[10.20 - 15.36]  in inner workings of iOS devices, are required to sign non-disclosure agreements as a condition
[15.36 - 21.12]  of access. Imagine a home security whose burglar detection system lets them secretly listen
[21.12 - 25.00]  in on your private moments at home and watch you through your CCD.

[0.00 - 6.00]  Now imagine that it was illegal to tell anyone about the way that system worked.
[6.00 - 8.00]  That's the world we're living in.
[10.00 - 12.00]  Back to the WCT.
[12.00 - 15.00]  At the start of this chapter, I wrote that the WCT created the digital law
[15.00 - 20.00]  for the nations of the world of domestic law with small variations from state to state.
[20.00 - 25.00]  But the truth is, most nations have followed the lead of the U.S. in going much further.

[0.00 - 6.08]  to the WCT requires. The WCT calls for laws against breaking a law to commit an act of
[6.08 - 12.36]  copyright of DNCA here in the US makes it illegal to break digital locks, period. Other
[12.36 - 17.88]  countries around the world have followed suit, often at the open explicit urging of the Office
[17.88 - 22.80]  of the US Trade Representative and lobbyists from the US entertainment industry, which
[22.80 - 24.80]  means that the problem is even.

[0.00 - 6.20]  worse than the WCT suggestion.
[6.20 - 8.80]  Chapter 1.9, Worse Than Nothing.
[8.80 - 13.52]  The technical implausibility and unintended consequences of digital locks are big problems
[13.52 - 15.20]  for digital lock makers.
[15.20 - 19.32]  But we're more interested in what digital locks do to creators and their investors,
[19.32 - 24.60]  and there's one important harm we need to discuss before we move on.

[0.00 - 3.20]  turn paying customers to pirates.
[3.20 - 6.60]  One thing we know about audiences is that they aren't very interested in hearing
[6.60 - 10.70]  excuses about why they can't buy the media they want, when they want it,
[10.70 - 12.96]  in the format they want to buy it in.
[12.96 - 17.32]  Study after study shows that overseas downloading of US TV shows drops off
[17.32 - 20.72]  sharply when those shows are put on the air internationally.
[20.72 - 24.76]  That is, people just want to watch the TV their pals are talking about on the internet.

[0.00 - 5.44]  pay for it if it's for sale, but if it's not, they'll just get it for free. Walking
[5.44 - 10.40]  users out doesn't reduce downloads, it reduces sales.
[10.40 - 16.64]  The first person to publish a program to break the digital locks on old-style DVDs in 1999
[16.64 - 23.64]  was Jhon Lech Johansson, a 15-year-old Norwegian teenager. DVD Jhon took up the project because

[4.16 - 8.32]  in order to watch the DVDs he bought, he had to break their locks.
[8.32 - 15.28]  Seven years later, Muslic64 broke HDDVD's DRM for similar reasons. He wanted to watch a legitimate
[15.28 - 21.20]  out-of-region DVD that he'd purchased. Both of these seminal figures in the history of digital
[21.20 - 24.96]  locks were inspired not by piracy, but by frustration.

[0.00 - 4.00]  the limits put on the legitimate media they'd paid good money for.
[4.00 - 10.70]  In 2007, NBC and Apple had a contract with the speed over the terms of sale for Apple's iTunes store.
[10.70 - 14.50]  NBC's material was withdrawn from iTunes for about nine months.
[14.50 - 20.80]  In 2008, researchers from Carnegie Mellon University released a paper investigating the file sharing of this blackout,
[20.80 - 23.80]  converting pirates without cannibalizing purchasers.
[23.80 - 25.00]  The impact of...

[0.00 - 4.98]  digital distribution on physical sales and internet piracy they found was that the contract
[4.98 - 11.34]  dispute resulted in a spike of downloads on pirate sites and not just of NBC material.
[11.34 - 15.56]  It seemed that once people who had been in the habit of buying their shows on iTunes
[15.56 - 21.08]  found their way onto the free-for-all file sharing sites, they clicked on everything
[21.08 - 25.04]  that looked interesting. Downloads of NBC shows went up a lot and down

[0.00 - 4.72]  downloads of everything else went up a little more interesting is what happened after the
[4.72 - 10.64]  NBC Apple dispute ended and the show's return to iTunes as the CMU paper showed, download
[10.64 - 15.84]  rates for those shows stayed higher than they had been before the blackout.
[15.84 - 20.32]  That is, fusing to sell their viewers the content they wanted in the format they preferred drove
[20.32 - 22.44]  those viewers to piracy.
[22.44 - 24.92]  Once the audience started pirating the content they wanted...

[0.00 - 5.12]  they quickly turned to pirating other content too. Having become aware of and proficient
[5.12 - 11.52]  in downloading, the audience developed a downloading habit that outlasted the end of the blackout.
[11.52 - 15.92]  Digital lock vendors will tell you that their wares aren't perfect, but they're better than nothing.
[16.48 - 21.92]  But the evidence is that digital locks are much worse. Industries that make widespread use of
[21.92 - 24.88]  digital locks see market powers shifting from creators and investors.



===== block_028.txt =====
[0.00 - 5.22]  to intermediaries. They don't reduce piracy and customers who run into
[5.22 - 9.14]  frustrations with digital locks are given an incentive to learn how to rip
[9.14 - 14.82]  off the whole supply chain. If you're a publisher, label, or studio, the answer is
[14.82 - 20.14]  simple. Don't let companies sell your goods with digital locks on them. And if
[20.14 - 23.82]  a company refuses to sell your goods unless they can put their locks on your
[23.82 - 26.14]  products?

[0.00 - 4.00]  Well, you can be pretty sure that those locks aren't there for your...
[4.00 - 11.00]  It's harder if you're a creator, because many of the biggest investors have bought into the idea of selling DRM or not at all.
[11.00 - 21.00]  When it comes down to negotiating DRM, you just have to make a decision about whether you're willing to let your creative work be put in some tech company's jail in order to make your investors happy,
[21.00 - 25.00]  or whether you'll keep shopping for a sane or better investor.

[0.00 - 4.88]  A few years back, I sold a children's picture book to the largest publisher in the world,
[4.88 - 10.00]  which then spent a couple of years developing it with me, commissioning rough illustrations
[10.00 - 14.40]  and going through several rounds of rewrites until it was something you were all excited about.
[14.40 - 18.72]  One of my editors I am publishing was also the head of its UK digital strategy,
[18.72 - 24.24]  and he and I were very simpatico as you might expect. After several months had gone by without a
[24.24 - 27.44]  contract, she was able to get a copy of the book.

[0.00 - 4.06]  showing up his office, he called me up and explained what had happened. He'd gone
[4.06 - 8.78]  to the contracts people and requested a no DRM guarantee for the digital editions of
[8.78 - 12.78]  my books. None of us thought it would be a problem since Nameless Giant is no other
[12.78 - 17.42]  formats, languages, and territory and in every case, its sales might work. But Nameless
[17.42 - 22.42]  Giant had a new directive from the very top of the business. From now on, all books had
[22.42 - 24.94]  to be acquired with e-book rights and all the books had to be acquired with e-book rights.

[0.00 - 6.72]  all ebooks would have DRM on them. My editor tried to negotiate. Can we not acquire the ebook rights?
[6.72 - 11.60]  No. Okay, how about we acquire them but promise not to use them? But it wasn't.
[11.60 - 16.88]  Finally, my editor explained to the contracts person that the expected return from the digital
[16.88 - 26.56]  edition was negative 80 pounds. That's negative 80 pounds.



===== block_029.txt =====
[0.00 - 6.40]  In other words, the company expected to lose 80 pounds on the digital edition based on
[6.40 - 9.44]  the performance of its other digital picture book.
[9.44 - 13.96]  The contracts person told my editor that the DRM was non-negotiable and that if it was
[13.96 - 17.28]  going to be a problem, he should cancel my contract.
[17.28 - 21.80]  So my editor was very hard to get angry with an editor who has just quit in protest over
[21.80 - 25.04]  your book getting canceled even in the face of your book.

[0.00 - 6.00]  getting cancelled. The story has a happy end. Nameless Giant sank thousands in developing a book
[6.00 - 11.04]  that I can now easily sell to one of its less doctrine blind competitors and I don't have to
[11.04 - 17.04]  let DRM companies lock up my copyrights. Also, my editor got a much better job.
