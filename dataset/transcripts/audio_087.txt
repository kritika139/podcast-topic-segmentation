[0.00 - 6.96]  as Alan Turing and John von Neumann, a new kind of new existence, the general purpose digital.
[6.96 - 11.20]  These machines arose from a theory of general purpose computation that showed that with a
[11.20 - 16.56]  simple set of logic gates and enough memory and time, you could compute any program that could
[16.56 - 22.32]  be represented symbolically. That is, general purpose computers are machines capable of running
[22.32 - 24.72]  every valid program you can write.
