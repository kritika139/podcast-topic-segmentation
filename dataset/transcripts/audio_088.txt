[0.00 - 3.44]  This principle gave birth to the modern computer as we understand it.
[3.44 - 7.80]  It suggests that all computers are equivalent on a fundamental level.
[7.80 - 12.72]  Any computational task can run on any computer, though some computers might take trillions

[14.64 - 16.96]  It's nearly miraculous this business.
[16.96 - 20.72]  Until the middle of the last century, most computers were purpose-built to compute in
