[0.00 - 6.60]  we make computers that can compute in every describable way. Our world is made up of general
[6.60 - 11.22]  purpose computers. This is the major reason that digital locks have been dead on arrival
[11.22 - 15.84]  since their first and why they continue to fail. We know how to build a computer that

[20.12 - 24.76]  that can solve all kinds of things. But we don't know how to design and build a computer
