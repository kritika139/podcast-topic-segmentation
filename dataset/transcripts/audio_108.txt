[0.00 - 2.80]  to manage enormous complex network.
[2.80 - 6.44]  The thing is, it's often cheaper to base all three models
[6.44 - 8.48]  on exactly the same hardware
[8.48 - 11.12]  and simply load different software and the factor
[11.12 - 12.72]  to make the products different.
[12.72 - 15.04]  This is innocuous in and of itself.
[15.04 - 17.28]  However, it leads to something awfully.
[17.28 - 19.08]  Once a company stands to lose money
[19.08 - 21.96]  by allowing customers to examine and modify its products
[21.96 - 24.68]  after they're sold by switching out that software,
[24.68 - 26.68]  it creates a new product.
