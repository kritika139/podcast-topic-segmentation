[0.00 - 4.88]  A few years back, I sold a children's picture book to the largest publisher in the world,
[4.88 - 10.00]  which then spent a couple of years developing it with me, commissioning rough illustrations
[10.00 - 14.40]  and going through several rounds of rewrites until it was something you were all excited about.
[14.40 - 18.72]  One of my editors I am publishing was also the head of its UK digital strategy,
[18.72 - 24.24]  and he and I were very simpatico as you might expect. After several months had gone by without a
[24.24 - 27.44]  contract, she was able to get a copy of the book.
