[0.00 - 4.96] heres another snippet. imagine for a moment that every book you bought at walmart could be
[4.96 - 10.88] shelved only on a bookcase from walmart. the books were designed with some kind of little divot
[10.88 - 16.96] in the spine so that they could sit flat only on a walmart shelf and printed with a special ink
[16.96 - 22.48] that glowed only under a walmart light bulb and only when held at a special angle you could attain
[22.48 - 24.88] only by sitting in a specially designed walmart.
