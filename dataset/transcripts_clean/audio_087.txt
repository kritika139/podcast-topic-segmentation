[0.00 - 6.96] as alan turing and john von neumann, a new kind of new existence, the general purpose digital.
[6.96 - 11.20] these machines arose from a theory of general purpose computation that showed that with a
[11.20 - 16.56] simple set of logic gates and enough memory and time, you could compute any program that could
[16.56 - 22.32] be represented symbolically. that is, general purpose computers are machines capable of running
[22.32 - 24.72] every valid program you can write.
