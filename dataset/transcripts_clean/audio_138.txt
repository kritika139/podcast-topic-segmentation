[0.00 - 4.88] a few years back, i sold a childrens picture book to the largest publisher in the world,
[4.88 - 10.00] which then spent a couple of years developing it with me, commissioning rough illustrations
[10.00 - 14.40] and going through several rounds of rewrites until it was something you were all excited about.
[14.40 - 18.72] one of my editors i am publishing was also the head of its uk digital strategy,
[18.72 - 24.24] and he and i were very simpatico as you might expect. after several months had gone by without a
[24.24 - 27.44] contract, she was able to get a copy of the book.
